    "text": "Hi folks! I’m Gabriel Odom, and I hope that this material was helpful to you.\nHistory of this material: I started writing the very first versions of these lessons back in spring of 2018 when I was a postdoc at the Sylvester Comprehensive Cancer Center. The Biostats/Bioinformatics group had weekly “research clinics” for the other postdocs and junior faculty to learn about various computational topics that could be helpful in their work. This material started off as four lessons (I can’t remember exactly what the topics were, but I think it was intro to R, ggplot, organizing work into scripts, and dplyr). The lessons were well received. That fall, I ended up teaching 9 weeks on R as part of “Survey of Statistical Computing” for the grad students in the school of medicine, and I also joined The Carpentries group at the University of Miami. After I joined Florida International University, I spent some time building out these lessons semester after semester (and with help and feedback from some awesome graduate students), and I taught this class every year. Now, I’m finally organizing and restructuring most of the lessons and scripts that I’ve worked on and taught from these past few years into a website to help my students have easy access to the material even after they finish class.\nMotivation: My experiences teaching with The Carpentries, to medical school students, and to public health students gave me a lot of one-on-one time with high-performing people who did not come from math / computer science backgrounds. I want to present the material in a logical way to people with hardly any computing background, but who still want to learn the basics for their research. As my friend Prof. Raymond Balise points out, we should assume students “can both point and click with a mouse”, and that’s about it. In that vein, if you come across parts of these lessons where I assume you know more than you do, please leave an issue ticket on the GitHub repository for this book (if you don’t know how to create a new issue, here’s a guide: https://www.techrepublic.com/article/how-to-create-github-issue/). I hope that this material is accessible to everyone.",

    "text": "What is an Object?\nAn object is like a basket or container to hold stuff. Let’s make our very first object. We are going to create an object named x, and store the number 2 in it:\n\nx &lt;- 2\n\nNow, we can recall this value any time we evaluate x.\n\nx\n\n[1] 2\n\n\nNow look at the “Environment” pane on the top right. You should see this:\n\nWhat happened? Consider this analogy: you have a small container, you put the number 2 in it, and you label the container as x.\n\nAn example in the real world is a container of food in the office refrigerator: it should have a label to identify what it is and who owns it, and it should contain some food or drink. So far, you have used “containers” without labelling them. When you executed 24 * 7, R created a container and put the number 168 in it. However, R is like a vigilant office administrator: anything unlabelled in the refrigerator will be tossed out! Thus, if you wanted access to this number again, you must calculate 24 * 7 from scratch.\nWe can perform calculations with objects just like we could with anything contained in that object. For instance, if you wanted 10 to the power of 2, we see that the following are equivalent:\n\n10 ^ 2\n\n[1] 100\n\n10 ^ x\n\n[1] 100\n\n\nJust like any real lunch container, we can always empty out old food and put new food in it. To do this, we simply assign some new value to x:\n\nx &lt;- 3\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nYou can use the keyboard shortcut Alt + - to insert the &lt;- symbol with spaces around it. Recall that to use a keyboard shortcut, the “+” symbol means “press these keys at the same time”.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNoteExercises\n\n\n\nExercises\n\nCreate an object named myState that holds your current state of residence (e.g., “Florida”). Use the logical check for equality to show that the myState object and the object “florida” are not equal.\nCreate a new object y which is x + 3. Examine y. Now assign x to be “FL”.

    "text": "Creating Lists\nThe most common example of a non-atomic vector is a list. Lists are vectors that can have any class of object as its elements—even other lists! They are the opposite of atomic. We have seen one such example so far: the attributes of an atomic vector are a list:\n\nattributes(DrGabriel)\n\n$names\n[1] \"Surname\"        \"FirstName\"      \"HighestDegrees\" \"Age\"           \n[5] \"City\"           \"State\"          \"MovedFrom\"      \"timeEmployed\"  \n\nclass(attributes(DrGabriel))\n\n[1] \"list\"\n\n\nLists give us flexibility to create an ID vector that has different classes of information, including other vectors! We create a new list with the function list():\n\n# Create a List\nDrGabriel_ls &lt;- list(\n  Surname   = \"Odom\",\n  Forename  = \"Gabriel\",\n  Male      = TRUE,\n  City      = \"Pembroke Pines\",\n  State     = factor(\"FL\", levels = state.abb),\n  CurrZIP   = 33025,\n  MovedFrom = \"TX\",\n  Age       = 31,\n  MaxDegree = c(\"PhD\", \"ThD\"),\n  TimeEmpl  = 2.1\n)\n\n# Inspect\nDrGabriel_ls\n\n$Surname\n[1] \"Odom\"\n\n$Forename\n[1] \"Gabriel\"\n\n$Male\n[1] TRUE\n\n$City\n[1] \"Pembroke Pines\"\n\n$State\n[1] FL\n50 Levels: AL AK AZ AR CA CO CT DE FL GA HI ID IL IN IA KS KY LA ME MD ...

    "text": "Creating Tibbles\nIn order to use tibbles, we need functions from the tidyverse. A tibble can be created by hand, but most commonly we generate them by importing tabular / spreasheet data (with the functions read_csv() or read_delim(); more on these in a week or so).\n\nlibrary(tidyverse)\n\nWe can create the same ID card as we did with the list() function, but in a rectangular / tabular form. We create a tibble with the tibble() function. Similar to the c() function, we can supply as many inputs as we want, as long as they are all vectors with the same length (notice that I changed the “highest degrees” back to a character vector with length 1 because of this restriction).\n\n# Create a Tibble\nDrGabriel_df &lt;- tibble(\n  Surname = \"Odom\",\n  FirstName = \"Gabriel\",\n  HighestDegrees = \"PhD, ThD\",\n  Age = 31,\n  City = \"Pembroke Pines\",\n  State = \"FL\",\n  MovedFrom = \"TX\",\n  TimeEmployed = 2.1\n)\n\n# Inspect\nDrGabriel_df\n\n# A tibble: 1 × 8\n  Surname FirstName HighestDegrees   Age City       State MovedFrom TimeEmployed\n  &lt;chr&gt;   &lt;chr&gt;     &lt;chr&gt;          &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;chr&gt;      &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt;            &lt;dbl&gt;\n1 Odom    Gabriel   PhD, ThD          31 Pembroke … FL    TX                 2.1\n\n\n(Technically I could have left the degrees entry as an atomic vector with 2 entries, but the tibble() function would have to try to figure out what I meant. Sometimes it guesses correctly, sometimes not. We will discuss the tibble() function more later.)\nAs with the atomic vectors, we can also find what R thinks about lists and how R stores this information:\n\nclass(DrGabriel_df)\n\n[1] \"tbl_df\"     \"tbl\"        \"data.frame\"\n\ntypeof(DrGabriel_df)\n\n[1] \"list\"\n\n\nNotice that R still stores a tibble as a list (we see this from the typeof() function). In a tibble, all the individual columns\n\nmust have the same class,\nmust have the same length.\n\nWhile these two restrictions apply within the columns, the entire data set often has different classes of data in each column. Here’s an example of superhero data:\n\nheroes_df &lt;- tibble(\n  subject_ID = factor(c(\"008\", \"016\", \"115\", \"027\", \"001\")),\n  name = c(\n    \"Wonder Woman\", \"Green Lantern\", \"Spider-Man\", \"Batman\", \"Superman\"\n  ),\n  alias = c(\n    \"Diana Prince\", \"Alan Scott\", \"Peter Parker\", \"Bruce Wayne\",\n    \"Clark Kent / Kal-El\"\n  ),\n  city = c(\n    \"Gateway City\", \"Capitol City\", \"New York City\", \"Gotham\", \"Metropolis\"\n  ),\n  male = c(FALSE, TRUE, TRUE, TRUE, TRUE),\n  heightCM = c(183.5, 182.9, 177.8, 188.0, 190.5),\n  weightKg = c(74.8, 91.2, 75.7, 95.3, 106.6),\n  firstRun = c(1941L, 1940L, 1962L, 1939L, 1938L)\n)\n\nNotice that when I create this tibble, each of the entries (columns) are the same length (5 elements each), within each column the classes do not change (column heightCM is all numeric, column city is all character, etc.).\nWe check what this looks like:\n\nheroes_df\n\n# A tibble: 5 × 8\n  subject_ID name          alias          city  male  heightCM weightKg firstRun\n  &lt;fct&gt;      &lt;chr&gt;         &lt;chr&gt;          &lt;chr&gt; &lt;lgl&gt;    &lt;dbl&gt;    &lt;dbl&gt;    &lt;int&gt;\n1 008        Wonder Woman  Diana Prince   Gate… FALSE     184.     74.8     1941\n2 016        Green Lantern Alan Scott     Capi… TRUE      183.     91.2     1940\n3 115        Spider-Man    Peter Parker   New … TRUE      178.     75.7     1962\n4 027        Batman        Bruce Wayne    Goth… TRUE      188      95.3     1939\n5 001        Superman      Clark Kent / … Metr… TRUE      190.    107.      1938\n\n\nWe see that the classes of the columns are displayed under the column names.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNoteExercise\n\n\n\nExercise\nAdd the code to create the tibble above to your script from last lesson.",

They are what people commonly used for statistics and plotting. However, tibbles are simply a modern hybrid of a table and a data frame, which includes many nice attributes, properties, and features. The main difference between tibbles and data frames is that data frames can only have columns of atomic vectors; the other restrictions are the same: only one class per column and all columns have the same length.\nMoving forward, we will make use of tibbles, but you will most likely see older code that uses data frames as you learn more of R.

    "section": "Boolean Subsetting",
    "text": "Boolean Subsetting\nBecause relational subsetting is Boolean (logical) subsetting with an additional step, we first discuss how logical subsetting rules work for non-atomic vectors. For lists, these rules work the same for lists in one dimension as they do for atomic vectors in one dimension.\nTibbles, however, are different. Recall that tibbles have positional subsetting properties through the row, column syntax and also the positional subsetting properties of lists. These properties hold true for logical subsetting.\n\nRow and Column Subsetting\nWe can create logical atomic vectors of the same lengths as the number of rows and columns of the tibble (as returned by the dim() function).\n\n# Dimension of the tibble:\ndim(heroes_df)\n\n[1] 5 8\n\n# Logical vector to match the rows (keep the last two):\nc(rep(FALSE, 3), rep(TRUE, 2))\n\n[1] FALSE FALSE FALSE  TRUE  TRUE\n\n# Logical vector to match the columns (keep the last four):\nrep(c(FALSE, TRUE), each = 4)\n\n[1] FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE  TRUE  TRUE  TRUE  TRUE\n\n# Subset the tibble:\nheroes_df[\n  # rows\n  c(rep(FALSE, 3), rep(TRUE, 2)),\n  # columns\n  rep(c(FALSE, TRUE), each = 4)\n]\n\n# A tibble: 2 × 4\n  male  heightCM weightKg firstRun\n  &lt;lgl&gt;    &lt;dbl&gt;    &lt;dbl&gt;    &lt;int&gt;\n1 TRUE      188      95.3     1939\n2 TRUE      190.    107.      1938\n\n\nDid you notice that I broke the last expression up over multiple lines? This is to make the code easier for humans to read. Another option I could have done is this (this is usually what I do):\n\n# Logical vector to match the rows (keep the last two):\nkeepRows_lgl &lt;- c(rep(FALSE, 3), rep(TRUE, 2))\n# Logical vector to match the columns (keep the last four):\nkeepCols_lgl &lt;- rep(c(FALSE, TRUE), each = 4)\n\n# Subset the tibble:\nheroes_df[keepRows_lgl, keepCols_lgl]\n\n# A tibble: 2 × 4\n  male  heightCM weightKg firstRun\n  &lt;lgl&gt;    &lt;dbl&gt;    &lt;dbl&gt;    &lt;int&gt;\n1 TRUE      188      95.3     1939\n2 TRUE      190.    107.      1938\n\n\n\n\nList Subsetting\nBecause tibbles are also lists, we can subset the columns of the tibble using a logical atomic vector with length equal to the number of columns. This code will let us keep every other column starting with the second column:\n\nheroes_df[rep(c(FALSE, TRUE), times = 4)]\n\n# A tibble: 5 × 4\n  name          city          heightCM firstRun\n  &lt;chr&gt;         &lt;chr&gt;            &lt;dbl&gt;    &lt;int&gt;\n1 Wonder Woman  Gateway City      184.     1941\n2 Green Lantern Capitol City      183.     1940\n3 Spider-Man    New York City     178.     1962\n4 Batman        Gotham            188      1939\n5 Superman      Metropolis        190.     1938\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNoteExercise\n\n\n\nExercise\nSubset the tibble by every other row and column.\n\n\n\n\nCharacter Set Membership\nFor numeric and logical atomic vectors, we can make easy Boolean comparisons. “Is this value TRUE?” “Are these numbers less than 0?” Unfortunately, comparisons for character vectors are not as easy. We need new functions to measure if one character string belongs to a character vector. However, character set membership operators share this with other comparison operators: they must return logical values.\n\nExact Matching\nIf we want to find if one string is an element of a set of strings exactly, we can use the “in” operator: %in%. This is helpful if you have many possible spellings or abbreviations of the same word or idea:\n\n\"Florida\" %in% c(\"FL\", \"Fl\", \"fl\", \"Florida\", \"florida\")\n\n[1] TRUE\n\n\"Georgia\" %in% c(\"FL\", \"Fl\", \"fl\", \"Florida\", \"florida\")\n\n[1] FALSE\n\n\nThis matching is exact: the character string on the left of %in% must match exactly to one of the elements of the character vector on the right. This means the following checks will fail:\n\n\"Florida State\" %in% c(\"FL\", \"Fl\", \"fl\", \"Florida\", \"florida\")\n\n[1] FALSE\n\n\"Florida\" %in% c(\"FL\", \"Fl\", \"fl\", \"State of Florida\", \"florida\")\n\n[1] FALSE\n\n\n\n\nPartial Matching\nIf we want to find if a string is part of another string, we use the string detection function: str_detect(). This function is from the stringr package, which is part of the tidyverse (more on this later this semester).\n\nstr_detect(\n  string = c(\"FL\", \"Fl\", \"fl\", \"State of Florida\", \"florida\", \"Florida\"),\n  pattern = \"Florida\"\n)\n\n[1] FALSE FALSE FALSE  TRUE FALSE  TRUE\n\n\nWe know that the labels \"State of Florida\" and \"Florida\" match our search, but \"florida\" does not.",

Run pull(heroes_df, city). Compare these results to heroes_df$city. Why do you think the pull() function might be useful?\n\n\n\nSymbol Objects\nThis function is very different. Instead of taking in the name of the element as a character string, it takes in the name as a symbol. If you remember our flowchart on objects from last class, recall that there was a small box connecting “Functions” to “Vectors” labelled “Languages”; symbols are language objects: they help R connect functions to vectors. You have technically used symbols since the second day of class. Consider this example:\n\nmyIntegers &lt;- 1:10\nmean(x = myIntegers)\n\nNotice that I did not type myIntegers in quotes (as \"myIntegers\"). When R sees a reference to something other than all letters, crazy symbols, or TRUE / FALSE, R interprets what you typed as a symbol to be evaluated (think back to our rules for naming objects in lesson 5). R will look in your Global Environment for the object named what you typed. In the example above, R isn’t taking the mean of the letters myIntegers, but rather replacing that symbol with the atomic vector 1:10.\n\n\nSymbol Subsetting\nWe have seen this behaviour before, when we created plots with ggplot. The aes() function took in displ and hwy as symbols, and looked for objects with those names in the supplied mpg data set instead of in the Global environment. Because this is a very complex but powerful tool, we will return to it in a few lessons.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNoteExercises\n\n\n\nExercises\n\nExtract the non-existent Publisher column from the heroes_df tibble using the $ function.

    "text": "Read the Data\nNow that you have raw data files, import them into R (you will have to update the path to these data sets based on how you saved these files on your computer). ACS data files often have more than one row of column names (the first row is a unique ID for the column, and sometimes the next 1-2 rows are metadata about the column). In our case, we have character information we don’t want at the tops of our columns, so we will import the column names first, then import the data.\n\nSNAP Data Values\nWe first define a path to our data values (remember to update this to match your machine), then we import only the column headers for this data (that’s the n_max = 0 part). After we have the names we want, we can import the rest of the data—skipping the first two rows—but using the names we calculated in the step before.\n\ndata_path &lt;- \"../_data/ACSST5Y2021_S2201/ACSST5Y2021.S2201-Data.csv\"\ncolNames_char &lt;- names(read_csv(data_path, n_max = 0))\n\nNew names:\nRows: 0 Columns: 459\n── Column specification\n──────────────────────────────────────────────────────── Delimiter: \",\" chr\n(459): GEO_ID, NAME, S2201_C01_001E, S2201_C01_001M, S2201_C01_002E, S22...\nℹ Use `spec()` to retrieve the full column specification for this data. ℹ\nSpecify the column types or set `show_col_types = FALSE` to quiet this message.\n• `` -&gt; `...459`\n\nFLallZIP_df &lt;- read_csv(\n  file = data_path,\n  col_names = colNames_char,\n  skip = 2\n)\n\nRows: 1013 Columns: 459\n── Column specification ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\nDelimiter: \",\"\nchr (236): GEO_ID, NAME, S2201_C01_034E, S2201_C01_034M, S2201_C02_001E, S22...\ndbl (222): S2201_C01_001E, S2201_C01_001M, S2201_C01_002E, S2201_C01_002M, S...\nlgl   (1): ...459\n\nℹ Use `spec()` to retrieve the full column specification for this data.\nℹ Specify the column types or set `show_col_types = FALSE` to quiet this message.\n\n\nThe meta-data doesn’t need those tricks.

This information should allow us to find out what the column codes mean.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNoteExercise\n\n\n\nExercise\nSpend some time looking through the columns of this dataset and their classes. Many of the columns are numeric and many are character; some columns that are character shouldn’t be. Discuss this with your neighbours and think about solutions to figure out how to detect columns that should be numeric but are not.\n\n\n\n\nUpdated Summary Function\nRecall our lesson on functions last week. Based on this lesson, we are able to write an updated version of the summary() function. Our summary function should print the most common unique values for character information, but call the summary() function as normal for anything else:\n\nMySummary &lt;- function(x){\n  \n  if (is.character(x)){\n    \n    table(x) %&gt;% \n      sort(decreasing = TRUE) %&gt;%\n      head()\n    \n  } else {\n    summary(x)\n  }\n  \n}\n\n\n\nApply to the Raw Data\nNow that we have an updated function to take summaries of a tibble across the columns, let’s apply it to each column of the data (because this will print almost 500 results, we will apply this function to a random set of 50 columns as an example):\n\nset.seed(12345)\n# The first two columns are ZIP codes and geography IDs\nrandColumns_idx &lt;- sort(sample(3:ncol(FLallZIP_df), size = 50))\n\nmap(FLallZIP_df[, randColumns_idx], MySummary)\n\n$S2201_C01_006M\n   Min. 1st Qu.

    "section": "Detecting Strings",
    "text": "Detecting Strings\nFrom looking at the columns in the metadata table, it would probably be helpful to find if a word or phrase is contained in a character string. This is the function of str_detect(). As an example, let’s see if any of the features are specific to Hispanic households:\n\nFLmetadata_df %&gt;% \n  pull(Label) %&gt;% \n  str_detect(pattern = \"Hispanic\") %&gt;% \n  table()\n\n.\nFALSE  TRUE \n  434    24 \n\n\nAs we can see, this function returns a logical vector indicating if the string \"Hispanic\" is in the elements of the Label column, then the table() function tells us this information is present in only a handful of the columns. By itself, this isn’t helpful: we don’t know what the strings are, and we certainly don’t know which rows of the tibble they belong to. But at least we know that we have some data on Hispanic households.\nTo solve these problems, we combine str_detect() with mutate() and filter():\n\nFLmetadata_df %&gt;% \n  mutate(Hispanic_logi = str_detect(Label, \"Hispanic\")) %&gt;% \n  filter(Hispanic_logi) %&gt;% \n  select(-Hispanic_logi)\n\n# A tibble: 24 × 2\n   `Column Name`  Label                                                         \n   &lt;chr&gt;          &lt;chr&gt;                                                         \n 1 S2201_C01_032E Estimate!!Total!!Households!!RACE AND HISPANIC OR LATINO ORIG…\n 2 S2201_C01_032M Margin of Error!!Total!!Households!!RACE AND HISPANIC OR LATI…\n 3 S2201_C01_033E Estimate!!Total!!Households!!RACE AND HISPANIC OR LATINO ORIG…\n 4 S2201_C01_033M Margin of Error!!Total!!Households!!RACE AND HISPANIC OR LATI…\n 5 S2201_C02_032E Estimate!!Percent!!Households!!RACE AND HISPANIC OR LATINO OR…\n 6 S2201_C02_032M Margin of Error!!Percent!!Households!!RACE AND HISPANIC OR LA…\n 7 S2201_C02_033E Estimate!!Percent!!Households!!RACE AND HISPANIC OR LATINO OR…\n 8 S2201_C02_033M Margin of Error!!Percent!!Households!!RACE AND HISPANIC OR LA…\n 9 S2201_C03_032E Estimate!!Households receiving food stamps/SNAP!!Households!!…\n10 S2201_C03_032M Margin of Error!!Households receiving food stamps/SNAP!!House…\n# ℹ 14 more rows\n\n\nThis is a very nice result: we used the mutate() function to add a column of TRUE or FALSE values to the data frame to indicate if \"Hispanic\" was present in the column names (in the Label column). Then, we selected all of the rows where this indicator was TRUE, and then removed the indicator (because we no longer needed it).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNoteExercises\n\n\n\nExercises\n\nI explained the code above in a short paragraph after the code.

Strings are incredibly difficult to work with at times, so make sure you can always go back a few steps. This is why I saved the new look-up table with a different name. Personally, I usually append a number to the name of the object when I’m working with strings; then, when I’m sure I have done all the string clean-up I need, I save it with a better name and use rm() to remove the intermediate steps I no longer need.\n\n\nIn the dictionary/look-up table, we have all the information necessary to find the columns we want. However, before we dig into the look-up table, we notice that all of the rows are copied twice: one for estimate, and one for margin of error.

Also, the relationship looks non-linear, so I’ve added a LOESS estimate in blue.\n\nggplot(data = incomeSNAP_df) +\n  aes(x = median_household_income, y = food_stamp_prop) +\n  scale_x_log10(labels = scales::label_number()) +\n  geom_point(alpha = 0.3) +\n  geom_smooth(se = FALSE)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nIf you need to use one function one time from a package that you have installed on your computer, you can use the &lt;packName&gt;::&lt;funName&gt; syntax.

    "section": "Example: The Convergence of the Sample Mean",
    "text": "Example: The Convergence of the Sample Mean\nDuring this, my 12th lesson in statistical computing, we will finally do a little bit of “traditional” statistics. Here is the general premise: the sample mean is an “unbiased” estimator. That is, if you take larger and larger samples from the population, the difference between the sample mean and the population mean should get smaller. To test this, we will first generate a medium-sized population from a random normal distribution (the set.seed() function allows me to generate the same random population each time, so that everyone can reproduce the output of my code):\n\n# for reproducibility:\nset.seed(12345) # if you change this number, you will get a different sample\n\npopulation &lt;- rnorm(1000, mean = 1)\n\nWhat is the population mean (\\(\\mu\\))?\n\nmu &lt;- mean(population)\nmu\n\n[1] 1.046198\n\n\n\nList of Samples\nNow, we want to take samples from the population, where each sample is bigger than the last (think of a snowball sampling design where the longer the study goes, the more people you can recruit). That is, we will start with a small batch of subjects (values from population), calculate the sample mean (\\(\\bar{x}\\)), add a few more subjects, calculate the sample mean again, and repeat this until our sample estimate of the mean gets close to the true (population) mean. Because each sample will be bigger than the last, we must use a list.\n\nsamples_ls &lt;- list(\n  sample_0819 = population[1:5],\n  sample_0826 = population[1:10],\n  sample_0902 = population[1:15],\n  sample_0909 = population[1:20],\n  sample_0916 = population[1:25],\n  sample_0923 = population[1:30],\n  sample_0930 = population[1:40],\n  sample_1007 = population[1:50],\n  sample_1014 = population[1:75],\n  sample_1021 = population[1:100],\n  sample_1028 = population[1:125],\n  sample_1104 = population[1:150],\n  sample_1111 = population[1:175],\n  sample_1118 = population[1:200],\n  sample_1125 = population[1:250],\n  sample_1202 = population[1:300],\n  sample_1209 = population[1:400],\n  sample_1216 = population[1:500]\n)\n\n\n\nThe FOR Loop\nNow that we have our samples, we need to find the mean of each. Will simply taking the mean work?\n\nmean(samples_ls)\n\nWarning in mean.default(samples_ls): argument is not numeric or logical:\nreturning NA\n\n\n[1] NA\n\n\nUnfortunately no. Based on what we learned previously about FOR loops, we can use one of those:\n\n# Initialize\nnSamples &lt;- length(samples_ls)\nsampleMeans &lt;- rep(NA_real_, nSamples)\n\n# Loop\nfor (i in 1:nSamples) {\n  sampleMeans[i] &lt;- mean(samples_ls[[i]])\n}\n\nNotice that we are using the position of the elements of the vector. These are the mean values we calculated:\n\nsampleMeans\n\n [1] 1.2676164 0.8670559 1.0341290 1.0765168 0.9988227 1.0788070 1.2401853\n [8] 1.1795663 1.1853153 1.2451972 1.2386719 1.1591299 1.1271903 1.1452152\n[15] 1.1273959 1.0814062 1.1148737 1.0824608\n\n\nHow far are these from the true population mean? We set this loop up to fill values into a numeric vector, so we can use R’s vector power again:\n\nabs(mu - sampleMeans)\n\n [1] 0.22141820 0.17914231 0.01206915 0.03031865 0.04737545 0.03260885\n [7] 0.19398711 0.13336810 0.13911715 0.19899904 0.19247376 0.11293171\n[13] 0.08099210 0.09901700 0.08119775 0.03520808 0.06867550 0.03626262\n\nplot(x = lengths(samples_ls), y = abs(mu - sampleMeans), ylim = c(0, 0.3))\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe can see that, as my sample size grows, the difference between the sample mean and the population mean gets smaller.",

    "text": "Mapping a Defined Function to Values\nThis code was quite cumbersome. We had to measure how long the list was, create an empty atomic vector to hold our results, and then write the FOR loop to iterate over each position in the list of samples. On top of all of this, we’ve added this useless i object to the Global Environment, and the FOR loop lost the names of the samples! There is a better way: the map() function from the purrr package (included in the tidyverse, so remember to load that package):\n\nmap(samples_ls, mean)\n\n$sample_0819\n[1] 1.267616\n\n$sample_0826\n[1] 0.8670559\n\n$sample_0902\n[1] 1.034129\n\n$sample_0909\n[1] 1.076517\n\n$sample_0916\n[1] 0.9988227\n\n$sample_0923\n[1] 1.078807\n\n$sample_0930\n[1] 1.240185\n\n$sample_1007\n[1] 1.179566\n\n$sample_1014\n[1] 1.185315\n\n$sample_1021\n[1] 1.245197\n\n$sample_1028\n[1] 1.238672\n\n$sample_1104\n[1] 1.15913\n\n$sample_1111\n[1] 1.12719\n\n$sample_1118\n[1] 1.145215\n\n$sample_1125\n[1] 1.127396\n\n$sample_1202\n[1] 1.081406\n\n$sample_1209\n[1] 1.114874\n\n$sample_1216\n[1] 1.082461\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNoteExercises\n\n\n\nExercises\n\nThis function does return the values we want, but it does so as a list.

We are immediately motivated us to ask, “Can I write my own function for map() to use?” The answer is YES! More on that shortly…\n\n\n\nSample Means with map()\nBack to our first example, we still want to find out how close the sample mean gets to the population mean as we increase the sample size. For this, we write our own function to pass to map(). Recall the function constructor:\n\n# Create the function\nabsMean &lt;- function(xBar_num, mu_num){\n  abs(mean(xBar_num) - mu_num)\n}\n\n# Map it\n# Recall that the help file says that additional arguments to the function\n#   and their values are added after the function name.\nmap_dbl(sampleMeans, absMean, mu_num = mu)\n\n [1] 0.22141820 0.17914231 0.01206915 0.03031865 0.04737545 0.03260885\n [7] 0.19398711 0.13336810 0.13911715 0.19899904 0.19247376 0.11293171\n[13] 0.08099210 0.09901700 0.08119775 0.03520808 0.06867550 0.03626262\n\n\nThis matches the output of what we calculated using the FOR loop exactly, but with two added benefits: 1) we wrote a function (that could be reused elsewhere in our analysis), and 2) the map is self-contained—we didn’t have to initialize a vector or clean up after the FOR loop.\n\n\nAn Improved summary()\nWe saw that when we applied summary() to each column of a tibble, the character columns didn’t give us much information. We can then write our own summary function that prints the most common unique values:\n\nMySummaryFun &lt;- function(x){\n  \n  if (is.character(x)){\n    \n    table(x) %&gt;% \n      sort(decreasing = TRUE) %&gt;%\n      head()\n    \n  } else {\n    MyNumericSummaryFun(x)\n  }\n  \n}\n\nNow we can apply it to the mpg data set:\n\nmap(mpg, MySummaryFun)\n\n$manufacturer\nx\n     dodge     toyota volkswagen       ford  chevrolet       audi \n        37         34         27         25         19         18 \n\n$model\nx\n        caravan 2wd ram 1500 pickup 4wd               civic   dakota pickup 4wd \n                 11                  10                   9                   9 \n              jetta             mustang \n                  9                   9 \n\n$displ\n     Min   Q1.25%   Median     Mean   Q3.75%      Max   StdDev      IQR \n1.600000 2.400000 3.300000 3.471795 4.600000 7.000000 1.291959 2.200000 \n\n$year\n        Min      Q1.25%      Median        Mean      Q3.75%         Max \n1999.000000 1999.000000 2003.500000 2003.500000 2008.000000 2008.000000 \n     StdDev         IQR \n   4.509646    9.000000 \n\n$cyl\n     Min   Q1.25%   Median     Mean   Q3.75%      Max   StdDev      IQR \n4.000000 4.000000 6.000000 5.888889 8.000000 8.000000 1.611534 4.000000 \n\n$trans\nx\n  auto(l4) manual(m5)   auto(l5) manual(m6)   auto(s6)   auto(l6) \n        83         58         39         19         16          6 \n\n$drv\nx\n  f   4   r \n106 103  25 \n\n$cty\n      Min    Q1.25%    Median      Mean    Q3.75%       Max    StdDev       IQR \n 9.000000 14.000000 17.000000 16.858974 19.000000 35.000000  4.255946  5.000000 \n\n$hwy\n      Min    Q1.25%    Median      Mean    Q3.75%       Max    StdDev       IQR \n12.000000 18.000000 24.000000 23.440171 27.000000 44.000000  5.954643  9.000000 \n\n$fl\nx\n  r   p   e   d   c \n168  52   8   5   1 \n\n$class\nx\n       suv    compact    midsize subcompact     pickup    minivan \n        62         47         41         35         33         11 \n\n\nIt’s not terribly pretty (I am not a fan of the table() function), but it gives us a reasonable idea of what is going on in these columns.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNoteExercises\n\n\n\nExercises\n\nWhy do we only see at most 6 categories for the character information in our function?

You will find the function you need mentioned therein.\nUse the map() function combined with the sequence you just created to make a list of samples with increasing sizes from the population vector. Store it as another list of samples. This should make typing that list by hand obsolete.\nUse the map_dbl() function combined with the absMean() function we created to calculate the atomic vector of absolute differences from the sample mean. At what sample size does the estimate get better?\nFind one of the statistics / biostatistics students and contrast this process with the idea of “repeated sampling”. What is different here? Why doesn’t the traditional \\(n = 30\\) heuristic apply?\nRepeat the above process with the following modification: chain these operations together with pipes (%&gt;%).",

    "text": "Combine the Results\nWe have a list of the numeric summaries of life expectancy for each of the 142 countries. Let’s combine these results. First, we check the class of the individual list elements:\n\nclass(lifeExpSummary_ls[[1]])\n\n[1] \"numeric\"\n\n\nThe elements of the vector are numeric. If we want to end up with a tibble that has one row for each country, then the elements should first be transformed to be a one-row tibble. Unfortunately, there is not a standard as_*() function that will turn a named numeric vector into a one-row tibble. However, (very confusingly) the bind_rows() function will turn a named atomic vector into a one-row tibble. Let’s test it out:\n\n# Original named atomic vector\nlifeExpSummary_ls$Afghanistan\n\n      Min    Q1.25%    Median      Mean    Q3.75%       Max    StdDev       IQR \n28.801000 33.514250 39.146000 37.478833 41.696250 43.828000  5.098646  8.182000 \n\n# Tibble with one row\nbind_rows(lifeExpSummary_ls$Afghanistan)\n\n# A tibble: 1 × 8\n    Min `Q1.25%` Median  Mean `Q3.75%`   Max StdDev   IQR\n  &lt;dbl&gt;    &lt;dbl&gt;  &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt;    &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt;  &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt;\n1  28.8     33.5   39.1  37.5     41.7  43.8   5.10  8.18\n\n\nNow that we know this will work for one country, we can add it into a pipeline for all the countries. Then, calling the bind_rows() function a second time (using it as designed), we will end up with a tibble with a row for each country and 8 columns:\n\nlifeExpSummary_df &lt;- \n  lifeExpSummary_ls %&gt;% \n  map(bind_rows) %&gt;% \n  bind_rows(.id = \"country\")\n\nlifeExpSummary_df\n\n# A tibble: 142 × 9\n   country       Min `Q1.25%` Median  Mean `Q3.75%`   Max StdDev   IQR\n   &lt;chr&gt;       &lt;dbl&gt;    &lt;dbl&gt;  &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt;    &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt;  &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt;\n 1 Afghanistan  28.8     33.5   39.1  37.5     41.7  43.8   5.10  8.18\n 2 Albania      55.2     65.9   69.7  68.4     72.2  76.4   6.32  6.37\n 3 Algeria      43.1     50.6   59.7  59.0     68.1  72.3  10.3  17.5 \n 4 Angola       30.0     35.5   39.7  37.9     40.7  42.7   4.01  5.24\n 5 Argentina    62.5     65.5   69.2  69.1     72.2  75.3   4.19  6.71\n 6 Australia    69.1     71.1   74.1  74.7     77.9  81.2   4.15  6.82\n 7 Austria      66.8     70.0   72.7  73.1     76.4  79.8   4.38  6.42\n 8 Bahrain      50.9     59.2   67.3  65.6     72.9  75.6   8.57 13.8 \n 9 Bangladesh   37.5     42.9   48.5  49.8     56.9  64.1   9.03 14.0 \n10 Belgium      68       70.8   73.4  73.6     76.7  79.4   3.78  5.96\n# ℹ 132 more rows\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNoteExercise\n\n\n\nExercise\n\nIn the last exercise, we found the summaries of all the features for each country (not just the numeric ones).

If you want a good overview of how to use this package, read the “Importing Data” chapter of R for Data Science. We’ll load the tidyverse package suite now.\n\nlibrary(tidyverse)\n\n\nPackage Goals\nThe readr package has three main goals:\n\nBe faster than the base:: package reading functions (read.csv, read.delim, read.fwf, etc.).\nImport data as a tibble, so that we get the benefits of using tibbles, and we don’t mess up row and column names. For more on the tibble object, read their vignette: https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/tibble/vignettes/tibble.html\nOperate similarly on all operating systems.\n\n\n\nThe Main Function(s)\nThere is one main file-reading function in the readr package, and two extensions of this function for commonly-occuring data formats (there are obviously more functions than just these three, but knowing how two of these three work will help you import the majority of data files you will see in practice).\n\nread_delim: read any text-based delimited file into R as a tibble.\nread_csv: an extension of read_delim designed to make reading .csv files easy.\nread_tsv: an extension of read_delim designed to make reading tab-delimited .txt files easy.\n\nBecause these functions import data as a tibble (“table” + “data frame”), you should try to store data files such that each entry of a column is of the same atomic type (all character, numeric, logical, etc.).",

Let’s unpack all of our options:\n\nThe “Data Preview” pane shows you an Excel-style view of the first few rows and columns of your data:\n\nThe column names were imported correctly.\nThe readr package identifies the data type for each column by looking at the first 1000 rows (notice here that everything is a character; more on this shortly).\nThe down-arrow next to the column name lets you manually override readr’s best guess for the column data type, as well as include, skip, or include only the column:\n\n\nThe “Import Options” pane allows you more direct control over how the data file is imported:\n\n“Name” — what name do you want to give the data tibble in the working directory? Often, the file itself has a long name, so it’s better to name the tibble saved in your R environment a shorthand version.\n“Skip” — skip reading the first rows of the file. This is helpful if you have metadata in the first few rows of the file, and the data itself doesn’t start until later. NOTE: because there are two rows of “header” information, we will have to set skip = 1 for this data.\nCheck Box Options — these do what they say they do.\n“Delimiter: Comma” — this drop-down menu allows you to switch among commas, tabs, semicolons, white space, or other delimiters. The readr package correctly identified that our .csv file was comma-delimited.\n“NA” — how are missing values coded in your data? The drop-down menu has only a few options, but have more flexibility by interacting with the code itself (more on that in the next lesson).\n\nThe “Code Preview” pane shows you the results of all of the options you specified. Here is what the “Import Options” and “Code Preview” panes look like for the ACS SNAP .csv data:\n\n \nThe “Code Preview” pane shows what code will be ran automatically when I click the “Import” button in that window. Specifically, I’ve named the incoming data object FL_allZIPs, and I’ve turned off the automatic View() command.

We click “Import” and this code runs for us:\n\nFL_allZIPs &lt;- read_csv(\n  \"../_data/ACSST5Y2021_S2201/ACSST5Y2021.S2201-Data.csv\", \n  skip = 1\n)\n\nNew names:\nRows: 1013 Columns: 459\n── Column specification\n──────────────────────────────────────────────────────── Delimiter: \",\" chr\n(236): Geography, Geographic Area Name, Estimate!!Total!!Households!!HOU... dbl\n(222): Estimate!!Total!!Households, Margin of Error!!Total!!Households, ... lgl\n(1): ...459\nℹ Use `spec()` to retrieve the full column specification for this data. ℹ\nSpecify the column types or set `show_col_types = FALSE` to quiet this message.\n• `` -&gt; `...459`\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNoteExercise\n\n\n\nExercise\nImport the SNAP data into R.",

    "text": "Why Tidy Data\nMost of my work as a data scientist is extracting or cleaning data. As such, here are the reasons I use the tidy data format:\n\nIt is mathematically consistent. When we perform calculations with statistics, the notation of matrix algebra and calculus assume that the observations are in the rows of a matrix while the measurements are in its columns.\nKeeping the same structure for all raw data means I don’t waste time re-writing code to work with data in different formats. If I write code that works for one data set, it will usually work for another data set with only slight modifications.\nStoring measurements in columns of a tibble means that R treats the data set as a vector of atomic vectors (recall that a tibble is actually a list, and as such it is a non-atomic vector of other vectors). Because of this, we get to take advantages of R’s strength as a vectorised language.",

If you have never used regular expressions for string queries before, don’t be afraid. You can do most of the things you need without ever touching the matches() function. However, if you do find yourself needing some help with string manipulation in R, please see the stringr package cheat sheet from the RStudio Cheat Sheets page and the strings chapter from R for Data Science. You can also practice building expressions on https://regexr.com/. We will also learn a bit more about the stringr package in a later lesson.",

This function takes in the data table and an argument that follows the [new name] = [old name] syntax. For example, we notice that all of the column names with more than one word are written in snake_case except for tailnum. We can rename this column to match our naming convention. However, we must save the results of the output of the rename() function. Otherwise, the data table with the new column name will print to the screen but never be saved anywhere. We can use the names() function to check that our new name stuck.\n\nflights &lt;- rename(flights, tail_num = tailnum)\nnames(flights)\n\n [1] \"year\"           \"month\"          \"day\"            \"dep_time\"      \n [5] \"sched_dep_time\" \"dep_delay\"      \"arr_time\"       \"sched_arr_time\"\n [9] \"arr_delay\"      \"carrier\"        \"flight\"         \"tail_num\"      \n[13] \"origin\"         \"dest\"           \"air_time\"       \"distance\"      \n[17] \"hour\"           \"minute\"         \"time_hour\"     \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTipOverwriting Data\n\n\n\nNote that I am saving the old data set as a new data set with the same name.

We saw a variant of this when we used the case_when() function in the dplyr:: lesson. Here is an example.\n\n# Draw a single random number from the normal distribution\nxRand &lt;- rnorm(1)\n\n# If the value is negative, say so\nif (xRand &lt; 0) { \"This value is negative.\" }\n\nLet’s unpack this example. The if function is a special function that does not use the normal functionName(arg1 = val1) syntax. The syntax is if (CONDITION is TRUE) {DO TASK}. If the single atomic logical value in the parentheses is TRUE, then execute the expression in the curly braces. That is, if xRand &lt; 0 evaluates to TRUE, then print \"This value is negative.\"\nWhat about if the value is positive? We could add another if () {} control, or we could use the else function. Like the if function, it also has a special syntax that can only be used with an if function. That syntax is if (CONDITION is TRUE) {DO TASK} else {DO OTHER TASK}. For example:\n\n# Draw a new random number from the normal distribution\nxRand &lt;- rnorm(1)\n\nif (xRand &lt; 0) { \"This value is negative.\" } else { \"You're a winner!\" }\n\n[1] \"You're a winner!\"\n\n\nBecause these expressions can often span multiple lines, we often write IF/ ELSE controls like this:\n\n# Draw another new random number from the normal distribution\nxRand &lt;- rnorm(1)\n\nif (xRand &lt; 0) {\n  \"This value is negative.\"\n} else {\n  \"You're a winner!\"\n}\n\n[1] \"This value is negative.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNoteExercise\n\n\n\nExercise\nUse an IF/ELSE chain to replicate the functionality of the absolute value function (abs()).",

The FOR loop has the following syntax: for (INDEX in VECTOR) {EVALUATE f(INDEX)}, where f(INDEX) is some expression or function using the value of the index (though in some FOR loops the value of the index isn’t used at all).\nNow, it is important to understand the following: FOR loops are rarely useful for us to write directly in R, because R is a vectorised language. We could have done the exact same computation much simpler if we make use of R’s natural processing of vectors:\n\n(1:10) + 1\n\n [1]  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9 10 11\n\n\nBecause R is a vectorized language, the FOR loops are written for you already and hidden deep in the computer (if you want to know more, see this excellent post on vectorization in R). However, FOR loops in R are critical when we need to create a function whose values at one position depend on the values before it; these constraints occur when simulating or analyzing observations over time, where the value of the vector at position i depends on the value at i - 1. As a more complicated example, we will create the Fibonacci Sequence:\n\n# Create empty vector of length 50\nfiboRes_int &lt;- rep(NA_integer_, 50)\n# Initialize\nfiboRes_int[1] &lt;- 1L\nfiboRes_int[2] &lt;- 1L\n\nfor (i in 3:50) {\n  fiboRes_int[i] &lt;- fiboRes_int[i - 1] + fiboRes_int[i - 2]\n}\n\nWarning in fiboRes_int[i - 1] + fiboRes_int[i - 2]: NAs produced by integer\noverflow\n\nfiboRes_int\n\n [1]          1          1          2          3          5          8\n [7]         13         21         34         55         89        144\n[13]        233        377        610        987       1597       2584\n[19]       4181       6765      10946      17711      28657      46368\n[25]      75025     121393     196418     317811     514229     832040\n[31]    1346269    2178309    3524578    5702887    9227465   14930352\n[37]   24157817   39088169   63245986  102334155  165580141  267914296\n[43]  433494437  701408733 1134903170 1836311903         NA         NA\n[49]         NA         NA\n\n\nThe warning we see, and the missing values in the results vector, should serve as a warning that FOR loops are indeed powerful, but must be used with great care.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNoteExercise\n\n\n\nExercise\nRemove the print() call within the expression for the first FOR loop.

    "section": "WHILE and BREAK",
    "text": "WHILE and BREAK\nThe WHILE controller allows us to repeat a task for an undefined number of times. Unlike the FOR control, the WHILE control can continue to run indefinitely. USE WITH EXTREME CAUTION.\nWHILE loops are the foundation controller for most iterative mathematical algorithms. Because they can continue to compute indefinitely, they are also used to model scenarios where unknown or random forces act on objects. For example, pretend that we have a social game where an individual will continue to play until they reach a condition; e.g. speed dating, where a person (say “Todd, a software developer”) will continue to move from table to table until they find “the one”, upon which they exit the game.\nBecause WHILE loops can execute until the heat death of the universe, we recommend that you add a print statement that counts how many loops have been made. For example, let’s find out how many dates Todd goes on during the speed dating event:\n\n# Initialize\nhasDate &lt;- 0\nattempts &lt;- 1\n\nwhile (hasDate != 1) {\n  \n  # Make a condition that only happens with 2.5% chance\n  hasDate &lt;- rnorm(1) &lt; -1.96\n  attempts &lt;- attempts + 1\n  print(attempts)\n  \n}\n\n[1] 2\n[1] 3\n[1] 4\n[1] 5\n[1] 6\n[1] 7\n[1] 8\n[1] 9\n[1] 10\n[1] 11\n[1] 12\n[1] 13\n[1] 14\n[1] 15\n[1] 16\n[1] 17\n[1] 18\n[1] 19\n[1] 20\n[1] 21\n[1] 22\n[1] 23\n[1] 24\n[1] 25\n[1] 26\n[1] 27\n[1] 28\n[1] 29\n[1] 30\n[1] 31\n[1] 32\n[1] 33\n[1] 34\n[1] 35\n[1] 36\n[1] 37\n[1] 38\n[1] 39\n[1] 40\n[1] 41\n[1] 42\n[1] 43\n[1] 44\n[1] 45\n[1] 46\n[1] 47\n[1] 48\n[1] 49\n[1] 50\n[1] 51\n[1] 52\n[1] 53\n[1] 54\n[1] 55\n[1] 56\n[1] 57\n[1] 58\n[1] 59\n[1] 60\n\n\n\nThe WHILE loop repeated 60 times before the success condition was reached! In these cases, it would be nice to have a stopping condition. In our example, we can assume that there are only 30 potential date candidates for Todd to meet at the event, so we break the loop if we reach 30 attempts. This “exit” strategy uses the BREAK controller:\n\n# Initialize\nhasDate &lt;- 0\nattempts &lt;- 1\n\nwhile (hasDate != 1) {\n  \n  # Make a condition that only happens with 2.5% chance\n  hasDate &lt;- rnorm(1) &lt; -1.96\n  attempts &lt;- attempts + 1\n  \n  if(attempts &gt;= 30L){\n    \n    print(\"No date found.\")\n    break\n    \n  }\n  \n  print(attempts)\n  \n}\n\n[1] 2\n[1] 3\n[1] 4\n[1] 5\n[1] 6\n[1] 7\n[1] 8\n[1] 9\n[1] 10\n[1] 11\n[1] 12\n[1] 13\n[1] 14\n[1] 15\n[1] 16\n[1] 17\n[1] 18\n[1] 19\n[1] 20\n[1] 21\n[1] 22\n[1] 23\n[1] 24\n[1] 25\n[1] 26\n[1] 27\n[1] 28\n[1] 29\n[1] \"No date found.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNoteExercises\n\n\n\nExercises\n\nIf you have accidentally written a WHILE loop that runs for eternity, how do you stop it without closing RStudio entirely?\nRead the lessons under the “Decision and Loop” section of DataMentor’s R Programming page: https://www.datamentor.io/r-programming/#tutorial\n\n\n\nDid you notice that if, else, for, while, and break all changed colour when you typed them?

For example, we can create a function that finds the geometric mean of two numbers. In mathematics, this is \\[\nf(x_1, x_2) := \\sqrt{x_1 \\cdot x_2},\n\\] where the dot between the numbers is for multiplication. In code, this would be:\n\ngeomMean &lt;- function(a, b){ sqrt( a * b ) }\n\nOnce again, any time we create a function, we test it using values we know. For example, we know that the product of 5 and 20 is 100, and that the square root of 100 is 10. Thus, the geometric mean of 5 and 20 calculated by our function should be 10:\n\ngeomMean(5, 20)\n\n[1] 10",

Up to this point, both of our functions have only had one line, so that was the last line by default.\nFor example, we can write a version of the abs() function by nesting an an IF statement within a function.

    "section": "Function Environments and Scoping",
    "text": "Function Environments and Scoping\nWhen we called the function absoluteValue(num = 5), R created a brand new environment with one object binding: the object 5 was bound to the name num in this brand new environment. (This is the primary use of the = operator; it creates objects to be used within a function’s environment.) Note that we could not see this environment, but it was there. Our absoluteValue() function did its work, returned the absolute value of 5, and then R destroyed the environment it created. When we called the function a second time, R created a brand new environment that had no memory that the first environment ever existed and repeated the same process.\n\nInspecting the Function Expression\nLet’s take a look at the arguments and expression of the function:\n(num){\n  \n  out &lt;- num\n  \n  if(num &gt; 0){\n    return(out)\n  }\n  \n  -1 * out\n  \n}\nWhen we execute this function by running the code absoluteValue(5), R first creates a brand-new, completely empty environment, and then performs the assignment num = 5 in it. This action is also known as binding, so we could also say that R binds 5 to the name “num” in the function environment.\nThen, R executes the code in our expression, line by line, until the last line. So,\n\nR creates an object called out in this new environment and stores the number 5 in it. Then,\nR checks to see if the original value of num is positive; if so,\n\nR RETURNs the value of out.\nIf this check was not TRUE, then R reaches the last line of the function.\n\nFinally, if R reaches the last line, it sees the expression -1 * out, then evaluates it and returns the results. Because the function has reached its last line, we don’t need to explicitly type a RETURN control—it’s called automatically. Thus, the last line of this expression is to print to the “Console” the contents of the object out contained in the function environment.\n\n\n\n\nLooking “Up”\nWhen a function can’t find an object you reference in one environment, it “looks up” to the “next” environment. This action of “looking up” through environments is called scoping. The “next” environment up from your current environment is called the parent environment.\nNow, let’s create a new function that RETURNs the object out without defining it in the function environment:\n\nbadTestFun &lt;- function(){\n  out\n}\n\nbadTestFun()\n\n[1] \"This is a character string, and clearly not a number.\"\n\n\nNow, let’s try it on an object we know doesn’t exist in any environment:\n\nbadTestFun2 &lt;- function(){\n  object_that_I_know_doesnt_exist_because_this_name_is_long_and_dumb\n}\n\nbadTestFun2()\n\nError in badTestFun2(): object 'object_that_I_know_doesnt_exist_because_this_name_is_long_and_dumb' not found\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNoteExercises\n\n\n\nExercises\n\nDiscuss what you think just happened.

For example we can create a vector of animal weights and assign it to a new object weight_g:\n\nweight_g &lt;- c(50, 60, 65, 82)\nweight_g\n\n[1] 50 60 65 82\n\n\nA vector can also contain characters:\n\nanimals &lt;- c(\"mouse\", \"rat\", \"dog\")\nanimals\n\n[1] \"mouse\" \"rat\"   \"dog\"  \n\n\nRembember that the quotes around “mouse”, “rat”, etc. are essential here. Without these quotes, R will assume there are objects named mouse, rat, and dog. Unless these objects exist in the Global Environment or some of the other environments you have loaded (they shouldn’t), you will get an error message.\n\nanimals &lt;- c(mouse, rat)\n\nError: object 'mouse' not found\n\n\nYou can also use the c() function to add other elements to one of your existing vectors:\n\n# add to the end of the vector\nweight_g &lt;- c(weight_g, 90) \n# add to the beginning of the vector\nweight_g &lt;- c(30, weight_g) \nweight_g\n\n[1] 30 50 60 65 82 90\n\n\nIn the first line, we take the original vector weight_g, add the value 90 to the end of it, and save the result back into weight_g. The second time, we add the value 30 to the beginning, and again save the result back into weight_g.

    "text": "Atomic Classes\nThe basic atomic classes in R (in order of complexity) are\n\nlogical: This is the most basic type of information that can be stored in R. A vector with elements of class logical is a vector of only TRUE or FALSE values.\ninteger: This is the second-most basic type of information. An integer vector is a vector of positive or negative counting numbers (and 0).\nnumeric: This is the class for the Real numbers in R. Any object of class integer is necessarily also an object of class numeric, but the reverse is not true.\ncomplex: This class allows us to represent complex numbers (real and imaginary parts; e.g., 1 + 4i). In the health sciences, we won’t use objects of this class very often, if ever.\ncharacter: This is the most complex class of atomic information. This class ensures that the information you type into R stays marked with the keystrokes you typed to enter it. Therefore, \"10\" is not recorded as the integer 10, or the real number 10.000000…, but rather the combined keystrokes of the “1” and “0” keys on your keyboard (to be very technical, “1” and “0” are stored with the ASCII code 049 and 048, respectively, or perhaps as a UTF-8 encoded value).\n\nThere is one other class below logical in complexity: raw. It measures bits of computer information. We will not use objects of this class.",

The other methods had you specify the vector element(s) you would like to keep or the vector element(s) you would like to discard. However, the Boolean subsetting method has you create a logical vector of the same length as dimension you are interested in subsetting over, and passing it through the [ function.\n\nReview: Logic and Logical Operators\nRecall that logical values in R are represented by the reserved symbols TRUE and FALSE. Here is a nice picture (shamelessly borrowed from R for Data Science). \n\nAND, OR, and NOT\nThere are three logical operators we will commonly employ: AND, OR, and NOT.\n\nx &lt;- TRUE\ny &lt;- FALSE\n\n# OR: Are either x or y TRUE?\nx | y \n\n[1] TRUE\n\n# AND: Are both x and y TRUE?\nx & y \n\n[1] FALSE\n\n# NOT: What is the opposite of x?\n!x    \n\n[1] FALSE\n\n\n\n\nSet Membership and XOR\nThere are two more operators to think about, but they are shorthands for the primary three.\nThe XOR operator asks “are x or y TRUE, but not both?”\n\n(x | y) & !(x & y)\n\n[1] TRUE\n\nxor(x, y)\n\n[1] TRUE\n\n\nThe set membership operator is %in%; it is one of the “infix” operators, like + or -, because it sits “in” between its two arguments. It checks if a value is included in a set of values.\n\nA &lt;- 2\nA == 1 | A == 2 | A == 3\n\n[1] TRUE\n\nA %in% c(1, 2, 3)\n\n[1] TRUE\n\n\n\n\n\nRepeating Values\nBefore we move on to the specific vector-type examples, it is helpful to have a function to repeat values. If you would like to create a vector of six TRUE values in a row, we can use the rep() function.\n\nrep(TRUE, times = 6)\n\n[1] TRUE TRUE TRUE TRUE TRUE TRUE\n\n\nWe can combine this with the c() function for very powerful results.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNoteExercises\n\n\n\nExercises\n\nUse the c() function with the rep() function to repeat the vector TRUE, FALSE, FALSE four times.\nCheck the help file of the rep() function to create the vector below:\n\n1 1 1 1 1 2 2 2 2 2 3 3 3 3 3 4 4 4 4 4 5 5 5 5 5\n\nNow create this vector using arguments to the rep() function:\n\n1 2 2 3 3 3 4 4 4 4 5 5 5 5 5\n\n\n\n\nLogical Subsetting\nWe want to keep the ages for every other child starting after me:\n\nages_int\n\n[1] 31 29 27 25 23 21\n\nages_int[rep(c(FALSE, TRUE), times = 3)]\n\n[1] 29 25 21\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNoteExercises\n\n\n\nExercises\n\nUse Boolean subsetting with the rep() function to extract the last three ages.\nUse Boolean subsetting to “de-identify” your electronic ID vector.",

    "text": "Missing Data in Atomic Vectors\nMissing values in R are represented by NA: not -999, ?, \" \", \".\", or even NaN. When you import any data into R, pay attention to the missing value codes from other data analysis software. R treats missing values (the NAs) as a statement saying “I don’t know”. Also, understand that missing values are “contagious” in R. Here are some examples:\n\nNA &lt; 3    # Is something I don't know less than 3? I don't know.\n\n[1] NA\n\nNA * 2    # What is \"I don't know\" multiplied by 2? I don't know.\n\n[1] NA\n\nNA & TRUE # Are these both TRUE? I don't know.\n\n[1] NA\n\nNA | TRUE # Are either of these TRUE? Yes, one of them is TRUE.\n\n[1] TRUE\n\nNA == NA  # Is something I don't know equal to something else I don't know? I don't know.\n\n[1] NA\n\nis.na(NA) # Is this something we don't know? Yes.\n\n[1] TRUE\n\n\n\nType-Specific Missing Values\nBecause there are multiple types of atomic data, there are technically multiple types of NA. They all start with NA.\n\nNA: This is the missing value marker for a logical vector.\nNA_integer_: This is the missing value marker for an integer vector.\nNA_real_: This is the missing value marker for a double vector. Remember that numeric vectors have two types: integer or double. This missing value breaks with the naming convention, but I don’t know why.\nNA_character_: This is the missing value marker for a character vector.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNoteExercise\n\n\n\nExercise\nConfirm with both the typeof() and class() functions that these missing values have the types and classes that they should.\n\n\n\n\nArithmetically-Induced “Missing” Values\nThere are some times that the results of a function are mathematically “missing” (I am putting this word in quotes because it’s not true; the values aren’t missing, people just think they are). For instance, from algebra we remember that anything divided by 0 does not exist. It’s not that this value is “missing”, it’s that this value cannot exist by definition.\nHere is how R handles special arthimetically-induced “missingness”:\n\nlog(-1)\n\n[1] NaN\n\n1 / (0 ^ 2)\n\n[1] Inf\n\n-1 / (0 ^ 2)\n\n[1] -Inf\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTipNote on Division by Zero\n\n\n\nMost computer languages differ in how they handle the quantity 1 / 0. R, Mathematica, and FORTRAN treat it as Inf; C++ treats it as a “floating point exception”; Python has a special class of results to handle these cases called a ZeroDivisionError; SAS issues a warning and replaces the value with the missing value symbol, .. Overall, you shouldn’t be dividing by 0 very often, but just be aware that these exceptions in computer arithmetic can trip you up.",

    "text": "Missing Values in Non-Atomic Vector Types\nWe will cover non-atomic vectors in the next lesson, but I want to give a brief comment about the NULL value we saw earlier. Because non-atomic vectors are defined by what behaviour they don’t show, it’s nearly impossible to list all of the types on non-atomic vectors. It would be like trying to define the idea of “cold” without having any idea of what “warm” or “hot” means. Non-atomic vectors are what they are simply because they are not atomic.\nBecause of this, we use the NULL symbol to denote a missing non-atomic value. Recall the attributes of an atomic vector:\n\n# With Attributes\nx1 &lt;- c(height = 73)\nattributes(x1)\n\n$names\n[1] \"height\"\n\n# Without Attributes\nx2 &lt;- 73\nattributes(x2)\n\nNULL\n\n\nWhat is the difference between these two? Recall that attributes are stored as a list, making them non-atomic. Therefore, when attributes are missing or empty, R treats them as NULL. Again, don’t worry so much about this yet, because the next lesson is all about lists (non-atomic data).",

These lines tell R crucial information about how to build your report. The entire header, and all of the document options in it, are bounded by the three horizontal dashes (---) above and below.\nCurrently our header is quite basic. It includes:\n\nThe title of the document; title: \"My First Quarto\"\nWho wrote it: author: \"Gabriel Odom\"\nToday’s date: date: \"format(Sys.time(), '%b %d, %Y')\" (this looks crazy, but don’t worry about it now; we will learn what this means later if we need to)\nThe output type: format: html\n\nNotice that each one of these options (other than the date) are directly filled by your choices in the previous window.\n\n\nCode Chunks\nThe next thing we see is a code chunk. Code chunks look like this:\n\nThe components are:\n\nComputing language: Quarto documents can compile more than just R code, but we specify the language R here (with r).\nChunk name: this part is not required, but it can be helpful if you have errors in your code to know where they come from.\nChunk options: there are a few common options, which we will discuss later. This echo=false option means that this code chunk will not be included in the report output.\nChunk delimiters: all code chunks start and end with three backticks (```). If you want code that will run in a certain language (which most of the time, we do), add {} after the opening set of backtick delimiters, and put the language in first. For example, a basic code chunk could look like\n\n\n\nChunk body: this is where you put the actual R code that you want to compute.\n\nNotice two more things: 1) code chunks are on a grey background so they are easier to spot in the document, and 2) you can test the code in the chunk by clicking the green “Run Current Chunk” button on the top right.\n\n\nMarkup Text\nNow that you have a report with a header and some code, you need to explain what your code is doing and why.

The argument ties back to how you mapped the variable in the original plot. You can also only change the title of the legend with this function, not the labels.\nIn base_plot_gg, we used color = as_factor(Male) to map discrete color onto the variable Male.

There are several of these functions, all of the same form:\n\nscale_color_discrete()\nscale_fill_discrete()\nscale_linetype_discrete()\nscale_shape_discrete()\nscale_size_discrete()\nscale_alpha_discrete()\n\nUse the appropriate one for your variable type: if you mapped the variable to the fill attribute then use fill; if you mapped the variable to the shape attribute then use shape; etc.\n\nggplot(data = FirstYearGPA) +\n  aes(\n    x = HSGPA, \n    y = GPA, \n    color = as_factor(Male)\n  ) +\n  scale_color_discrete(\n    name = \"Sex\",\n    labels = c(\"Female\", \"Male\"),\n    breaks = c(0, 1)\n  ) +\n  geom_point()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNotice that we supplied the new labels to the feature mapped to color.

If I didn’t, the X axis labels won’t show up at all (axis label or category labels).\nIn scale_x_discrete(), I specified which category the labels go with: \"0\" = \"Female\", \"1\" = \"Male\". This is not actually required here because R sorts alphabetically, but you should do this by default.\nNotice the location of the line and star. I had to adjust their horizontal locations because factors in R do unexpected things: ggplot now places the bars at x = 1 and 2 instead of 0 and 1 because R is interpreting these factors as the numbers 1 and 2. We will discuss this more when we talk about atomic type coercion later this semester.",

As this section of data science deals with philosophy and ethics, it has hardly anything to do with academic statistics as the discipline has traditionally been taught.\n\nExamples: apply machine learning to analyze the provenance of art owned by Jews that had been seized by the Nazis or by political dissenters that had been seized by the Soviets, creating online courses to teach the basics of data science and reproducible research to non-scientists, writing commentary on the ethics of misleading graphs and figures in political campaigns.",

The most basic graphic of our data is a screenshot of it, but that usually doesn’t help anyone!\n\n\nGrammar of Graphics\nAs we see in the figure above, we need our graphics to follow a set of rules. A grammar is a set of the fundamental principles and rules of a discipline, so the grammar of graphics is the set of fundamental rules for displaying organised information (Wickham, 2010).\n\nA grammar provides a strong foundation for understanding a diverse range of graphics. A grammar may also help guide us on what a well-formed or correct graphic looks like, but there will still be many grammatically correct but nonsensical graphics. This is easy to see by analogy to the English language: good grammar is just the first step in creating a good sentence. - Hadley Wickham\n\n\n\nLayering\nIf grammar helps us construct a sentence in the proper way, layering helps us combine multiple sentences into a paragraph. We use layers to “stack” different levels of results and statistics. Let’s walk through Wickham’s original example (ibid., p. 4).\n\nExample Data\nConsider the following toy data:\n\n\n\nA\nB\nC\nD\n\n\n\n\n2\n3\n4\na\n\n\n1\n2\n1\na\n\n\n4\n5\n15\nb\n\n\n9\n9\n80\nb\n\n\n\nA simple research question we may have is, does changing C affect A, and is this effect mitigated by D? To answer this, we would probably build a scatterplot of C and A, with point size, shape, or colour set by D. That is, we assign C to take values on the horizontal axis, A to take values on the vertical axis, and D to take values on some other axis (shape, for instance). The resulting data set looks like this:\n\n\n\nx\ny\nShape\n\n\n\n\n2\n4\na\n\n\n1\n1\na\n\n\n4\n15\nb\n\n\n9\n80\nb\n\n\n\nNow, we are making some progress, but we still haven’t told the computer what to do with this information. Recall that one of the major goals of this class is to help you tell the computer what you want. Your computer needs to translate these points and shape labels into actual pixels on the screen.\n\n\nExample Data Mapped\nLet’s pretend that we give a 200 x 300 window to R to plot these points. The resulting pixel locations and shapes will look like this:\n\n\n\nx\ny\nShape\n\n\n\n\n25\n11\ncircle\n\n\n0\n0\ncircle\n\n\n75\n53\nsquare\n\n\n200\n300\nsquare\n\n\n\nThis yields one layer with the overall shape and behaviour of the data:\n\nNotice however, that we don’t have any scales for these values. The values R supplied to the computer are in shapes and pixel locations, but we humans can’t interpret what this means. We need another layer for the axes.\n\nFinally, we need a layer for the labels. When we stack these layers (axes, labels, then data), we see the following composed graph:\n\nWhen we construct figures, we often take for granted the complexity inherent in the task. For our work, we will be constructing figures layer by layer, so it is important to understand these mechanics.",

    "text": "Engine Size by Fuel Economy\nWe are going to construct a graph first. I will give you the code and the figure, then we will deconstruct it.\n\nggplot(data = mpg) +\n  aes(x = displ, y = hwy) +\n  geom_point()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe engine size is on the horizontal axis, the highway fuel efficiency is on the vertical axis, and—at first glance—it certainly seems that larger engines are less fuel efficient.\nWithin the code itself, the components in this code are organized in a logical manner and with a corresponding set of rules—that is, a grammar. That’s what the gg part stands for—the grammar of graphics.\n\n+: The Layer Glue\nNotice that each of the lines above are connected by the plus sign, “+”. In this context, the + symbol operates to “add” layers together, but you can still use it to add numbers too. If you are more familiar with R, but not familiar with the tidyverse, then the idea of “adding” one function to another seems absurd. However, as you’ll see soon, we can “add” more and more layers to a single graph with this + operator.\n\n\nThe data Layer\nThe first line in the code, ggplot(data = mpg), provides the base layer of the graphic. Recall the function syntax we have learned previously:\n\nThe function is named ggplot\nThe first argument of the function is called data\nWe supply the data set mpg as the value to this data argument\n\nThink of this as a blank canvas that you will paint on. In this case, the data set mpg provides the material from which to create the canvas.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNoteExercise\n\n\n\nExercise\nRun ggplot(data = mpg). What does this plot look like?\n\n\nThe ggplot() function takes data tables only in a certain form; they must have class data.frame. It’s not important for use to understand what this means right now.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNoteExercise\n\n\n\nExercise\nRecall the exercise from Lesson 1 on finding help? We first read about the str function then. Use the str() function to confirm that the mpg object has data.frame as one of its classes.\n\n\nIf you ever have trouble with ggplot(), make sure your data frame is tidy! Later this semester, we will discuss some things to do if your data table is not tidy (using the tidyr, tibble, and readr packages in the tidyverse).\n\n\nThe Aesthetic Mapping Layer\nNow that we have created a canvas to paint on, we need to choose our proverbial “colour palette” and plan where our “paint brush” will go. That is, we need to specify which measurements contained in the mpg data set we are going to use, and how they will influence the blank canvas. Now, consider the second line of code: aes(x = displ, y = hwy). Following what we know about function syntax, we can deconstruct this line as follows:\n\nThe function is named aes\nThe first argument of the function is named x\nWe supply the value of the object displ to the argument x\nThe second argument of the function is named y\nWe supply the value of the object hwy to the argument y\n\nNow, if you have been paying attention, you’ll notice that we don’t have any objects named displ or hwy in the “Environment” pane.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNoteExercises\n\n\n\nExercises\n\nRun displ and hwy in the “Console”. What happens?\nRun\n\n\nggplot(data = mpg) +\n  aes(x = displ, y = hwy)\n\n\nHow is this different from the first layer alone? Remember to use the “+” symbol to add one layer to another.\n\nWhere did R find the values for displ and hwy? What would you do if you needed to add different values to the aesthetic layer?\nAdd 3 and 5 together. Does it still return the number 8 even though 3 and 5 aren’t pieces of a ggplot graph? Discuss with your neighbours.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Geometric Object Layer\nWe now have a canvas to plot our points, and a system of axes to know where the points belong. Now we need to tell ggplot() how to plot x and y. This is where the the geom_*() functions come into play: we wanted a scatterplot, so we picked geom_point(). This is simply a call to the function geom_point with no arguments. “Geom” is short for “geometric object”, and there are quite a few geometric shapes we can bend our data into (please see Wickham’s ggplot2 book for more information).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNoteExercises\n\n\n\nExercises\n\nRun the original code (copied below) and compare it to the previous figure. What did the geometric layer add to the plot?\n\n\nggplot(data = mpg) +\n  aes(x = displ, y = hwy) +\n  geom_point()\n\n\nLook up the help manual for the geom_point function.

Values range from \\([0,1]\\), with \\(1\\) being completely opaque. Better for continuous features.\nshape: What shape should the points have? Better for discrete features. Options are shown below \nfill: For the shapes filled with red, what color should you put instead? Better for discrete features, but is limited when plotting points. The fill aesthetic truly shines with geoms other than point, but that is a bit beyond the scope of this lesson.\n\nFor most of these aesthetics, the behavior of the graph will change depending on if you map a discrete or continuous feature to it. For example, if you map a continuous feature to the colour aesthetic, the points will be given a continuous color gradient (by default, from dark blue to light blue). However, if you map character information to the colour aesthetic, the points will be distinctly different (discrete) in color.",

    "text": "Examples\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLook back to the figure. You might notice that there is a group of five points on the top right that stick out: these cars have large engines but higher MPG than other vehicles with large engines. We could ask a few questions to try to explain this disparity:\n\nAre these vehicles hybrids?\nDo these vehicles use diesel?\nAre these vehicles newer?\n\nEach question is a hypothesis, and we will attempt to “test” these hypotheses visually.\n\nHypothesis 1: Outlier Cars are Hybrids\nCheck the help documentation for the mpg data set to find out which column measures the type of the car. We probably won’t see “hybrid”” in this list, because we know that very few hybrid cars were in production in both 1998 and 2008. These cars would have all been classified as “compact” or “sub-compact”. Note: this is where “domain knowledge” is critical for proper data science.\nNow what type of feature is class? The column header of the mpg data table informs us that this feature is a character feature (chr), and therefore discrete. Thus, we can add it to the graph with the colour or shape aesthetics.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt appears that our hypothesis was incorrect. These vehicles are not small, hybrid cars at all, but “2 seater” cars or midsize cars.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNoteExercise\n\n\n\nExercise\nWrite the code necessary to create the above graph.\n\n\n\n\nHypothesis 2: Outlier Cars take Diesel\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOur hypothesis is incorrect. It appears that all five of our outlier vehicles take premium fuel (“p”), not diesel (“d”). This graph, when paired with the previous graph on car class, gives us a better understanding of factors that could influence the relationship between engine size and fuel economy.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNoteExercises\n\n\n\nExercises\n\nUsing the help manual for the mpg data set, find which feature of the data measures fuel type.\nWrite the code necessary to create the above graph. Hint: the shape of the points is controlled by the shape argument to the aes() function.\n\n\n\n\n\nHypothesis 3: Outlier Cars are Newer\nWe know that vehicle year can be either 1998 or 2008. Because the manufacture year is a time, we should add it to the graph with the colour, size, fill, or alpha aesthetics.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe manufacture year doesn’t help explain the five outlier points very well. They are rather evenly split between 2000 and 2008.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNoteExercise\n\n\n\nExercise\nWrite the code necessary to create the above graph. Hint: in this version of the figure, the shape is not dependent on the data, so it is not an aesthetic. Think about where you should put the shape argument if you can’t put it in the aes() function.\n\n\n\n\nUpdated Hypothesis: Outlier Cars are Sportscars\nWe can add more than 3 features to a plot. Let’s create an engine size by MPG plot with fuel type and car class added.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis looks promising: it appears that all five outliers take premium fuel, and four of the five outliers are 2-seater coupes. This means that our outliers are probably sports / performance cars: larger engines but lighter bodies.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNoteExercise\n\n\n\nExercise\nWrite the code necessary to create the above graph.\n\n\nIf you’re thinking to yourself, “I wish there was a way to clean this graph up, to only show the premium fuel and two-seater cars”, then you are thinking what I’m thinking. However, we need some functions from the dplyr package first, which we will cover in a few weeks. The ggplot package also gives us a way to break graphs into mutually-exclusive pieces, called facets, which we will discuss shortly.",

    "section": "Basic Function Syntax",
    "text": "Basic Function Syntax\nMost R functions look like this: functionName(argument1 = value1, argument2 = value2, ...). This function is an object called functionName. We don’t know what it does, because the operations of the function are stored within the object functionName. We do know that it takes in two arguments with two values, and does something to them. Let’s use a function to create our first matrix (I’ve annotated the code to show its similarities with an English sentence):\n\n# object      verb   subject1  adverb1   adverb2\nmyData_mat &lt;- matrix(data = 0, nrow = 5, ncol = 2)\nmyData_mat\n\n     [,1] [,2]\n[1,]    0    0\n[2,]    0    0\n[3,]    0    0\n[4,]    0    0\n[5,]    0    0\n\n\nNotice a few things. We used a function called matrix (a verb) with three arguments (data, nrow, and ncol). This function did some things behind the scenes (as defined in the object matrix), and returned an output. This output is a matrix of zeroes (the “noun”) with two columns and five rows (adverbs controlling how the verb should work). Not all functions use additional arguments to change their behaviour, but most do. The data input was recycled to fill the entire matrix.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNoteExercise\n\n\n\nExercise\nLabel the “subjects”, “verbs”, “adverbs”, and “objects” in the following code:\n\nggplot(data = mpg) +\n  aes(x = displ, y = hwy) +\n  geom_point()",

However, there are many instances where we need to create our own functions. Because we know that functions are also objects, we can create them just like anything else: with a creation function. Function creation has the following syntax:\n\nmyFun_fun &lt;- function(argument1){\n  \n  body\n  \n}\n\nWe can use this syntax to create a function to add two numbers (obviously this function already exists, but bear with me).\n\nmySum_fun &lt;- function(x, y){ x + y }\nmySum_fun(2, 3)\n\n[1] 5\n\n\nWe can create many of our own functions, and use these functions to accomplish very difficult tasks. This flexibility to create any function we can think of is one of R’s greatest strengths, but also part of what gives R its distinct learning curve.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNoteExercises\n\n\n\nExercises\n\nCreate a new function to greet someone good morning.

    "text": "Function Best Practices\nBecause R is a functional language, the functions you write should be the most important pieces of your code. Functions in R, through their inherent vectorized efficiency, turn this\nlsum &lt;- 0\nfor (i in 1:length(x)) {\n  lsum &lt;- lsum + log(x[i])\n}\ninto this\nlsum &lt;- sum(log(x))\n(This and other mortal R sins are covered in The R Inferno.) R is a functional programming language, so you must learn to use functions in your code. Furthermore, while this isn’t required, you should probably think about collecting the functions you write into a package. Here are some guidelines on writing functions:\n\nFunctions should do one major thing, only that thing, and do that thing well. A function that does a million things is easy to break and horribly difficult to check. Keep your functions simple, and you will not regret it.\nMajor functions should be saved in their own script files. This encourages your project code to be compartmentalized and organized. For projects, this is very important for testing and organization. Overall, I strongly recommend you do not store all of your functions in one file. If you have a ton of functions to source all at once, create a package. Even if you never plan to release the code to anyone outside your group, create a package anyway.\nUtility functions can be collected into one file. Because you probably do not need extensive documentation or checking of utility functions, you can store all related utility functions together.",

You write comments to three people: yourself today, yourself in six months, and people who have never seen your code. These comments will include:\n\nthe function name and description,\nnames and descriptions for each argument to the function,\na description of what the function returns,\na thorough commentary on how the function works,\nat least one working example, and\ncitation, external links, internal links, etc. all as appropriate.\n\nComments always have a single space between the comment character (#) and the start of the comment.

    "title": "Lesson 5: RStudio Projects",
    "section": "Code “Paragraph” Rules",
    "text": "Code “Paragraph” Rules\nJust like written paragraphs in English have certain rules, code scripts also have rules and best practices to help keep your work organized. Let’s consider an example data analysis for argument’s sake. We need to import the data, clean it, wrangle it (more on this next class), analyze it, and graph the results.\nThese rules are loosely ordered by importance:\n\nAll the code in one script should be related to one subtopic of your analysis. For instance, in the data analysis example above, we would create a seperate script for data import and cleaning, a script for wrangling and transformation, an analysis script, and a graphics script.\nScripts should be named (and often dated) based on what part of the workflow they handle. For example, the analysis script may be called breast_cancer_data_analysis_201906.R. Ordered files in a project pipeline should have leading numbers (00_clean_raw_data.R, 01_explore_clean_data.R, …) to keep presentation orderly.\nPartition chunks, or blocks, of code into sections with six pound signs on either side of a block title. This helps to keep your thoughts organized. Many times I will see that a code block has become very large, which prompts me that it should be it’s own script. In the RStudio IDE, when you name a code block, the name of that block will appear in the bottom left of the Editor pane, right next to the code GPS. If you haven’t organized your script into chunks yet, you should see (Top Level) or Untitled in this space. Here’s an example:\n\n######  New Code Section  #####################################################\n# A new code section in an R script is created with six pound signs (#), two\n#   spaces, the section description, two more spaces, and pound signs until the\n#   80th character slot is reached.\n\nNon-trivial code should be annotated with helpful or clarifying comments. Use the # (pound sign, or hashtag, depending on your age) to comment a single line of code in R. When you add comments to your code, try as much as possible to answer why you wrote the code that you did and the way you did, rather than simply parroting what your line of code does. Remember, comments should never simply “parrot” the code.\nLines in your script should be at or fewer than 80 characters wide whenever possible. You can use the “Code GPS” on the bottom left of the Editor pane to tell you where in the script you are. Why 80 characters per line? Because we are slaves to tradition. Different people have different size computer monitors, and lines that are 80 characters wide can easily be displayed on all sorts of screens. Also, 80-character lines fit on a printed page or in vignette PDFs very well. This rule serves another purpose: if your lines are consistently over 80 characters, this is a signal to you that you need to make your code simpler. If this is not possible, then think of this as an opportunity to write a function to make your code cleaner.\nUse two spaces (no tabs) for indentation. If you ever decide to release a package, then spacing becomes important for R documentation and meta-data files. It’s good to get into the habit of using the “two-space” indentation rule in any case; also, the RStudio IDE does this for you automatically most of the time.\nPad all operator calls with single spaces. Similar to the “80 characters wide” rule, this rule has no bearing on how the code executes, but makes a world of difference to human readability. An exception is commas: commas have one space after but no space before. Overall, don’tmakecodehardertoreadthanithastobe, and GIVE YOUR CODE SOME SPACE. Examples:\n\nrandErr_num &lt;- rnorm(25, sd = 0.1) instead of randErr_num&lt;-rnorm(25,sd=0.1).\nloss &lt;- 3 or loss &lt; -3 instead of loss&lt;-3.\nif (check) { instead of if(check){\n\nMinutiae:\n\nUse &lt;- for assignment, not =.\nDo not end lines with ;.\nUse double quotes (\") instead of single quotes (').",

    "section": "Project Directory",
    "text": "Project Directory\nInstead, organize your files by project. These directory names and contents are quite flexible. However, you should pick a directory design and be consistent with it. Here’s an example directory:\n\nThe project directory is for my lectures in the Quantitative Science Clinics for the Sylvester Comprehensive Cancer Center at the University of Miami. Within this directory, I have the following folders:\n\nCode (miscellaneous) or scripts. These are the code scripts to import and clean the data, perform the analysis, tidy the output, create figures and tables, and save the results. Remember, all of these scripts should be related to the current project!\nPackage directory for the project (optional). If you created a package (pipeline) to analyze any data of a certain type, the package should be in the directory you use it (unless it’s a pipeline you use for many different projects, then it should probably be hosted on GitHub).\nRaw and clean data. Any input files go in this folder (even if you pre-process them). Unless the point of your project is to simply clean data, then cleaned data is not an output!\nArticles, user guides, or manuals (often for the literature review of the manuscript or report that you will write to accompany the project). These are the papers, books, articles, etc. you had to read to understand the project. This directory should also include setup documentation from your PI and any data dictionaries. Any written documentation that helped you set up your work or understand your team’s work goes here. Also, this is where you save the bibliography files.\nWritten summaries and manuscript files (drafts, LaTeX logs, etc.). When writing a LaTeX manuscript or an .html report, I usually put each draft in its own subfolder. Also, when you write papers, make sure to mark the draft number as the first two characters of the file name; e.g. 01-draft_modifiedPCA.docx, 02-draft_modifiedPCA.docx. I’ve often seen that one number isn’t enough (only 9 potential drafts). This keeps you from wasting time looking for the latest version.\nProject README. This should be a simple text (.txt) or markdown (.md) file that explains what the point of the project is, and where to find all of the important files. Also, this document should have the start date of the project, the date of the most recent major revision, and the names and emails of your main collaborators. This way, if you reference a “Mandy” somewhere in your notes or file names, everyone know you’re talking about “Amanda from the statistics department”.\nFigures and tables (output files). If your paper has a results section, all that information goes here. Everything that is an “end” of an analysis goes here.\nRStudio Project File. If I were to double-click on this file, RStudio would open with all of my files that I was working in when I last saved that project. When you use RStudio projects, you don’t have to remember all the files you had in use and manually re-open them. I recommend that as soon as you have more that one script (or a single long script that you really should have broken into a few different scripts already—jeez), you create an RStudio project to organize your files.",

    "text": "DO NOT: Save your workspace\nGet in the habit of starting the day’s work with a fresh environment. This will reduce the “it worked on my machine” errors considerably. You want to periodically restart R and re-run your scripts to ensure that the code results you are seeing aren’t the result of some hidden artefact or forgotten object definition. I restart my R session and re-run my scripts around once per hour or so. To quote the masters,\n\nWith your R scripts (and your data files), you can recreate the environment. It’s much harder to recreate your R scripts from your environment! You’ll either have to retype a lot of code from memory (making mistakes all the way) or you’ll have to carefully mine your R history. - Wickam and Grolemund, R for Data Science\n\nTo this end, I strongly recommend you remove the “restore workspace” option in RStudio (“Tools”” /&gt; “Global Options”).\n\nThe keyboard shortcut for “restart and rerun” is CTRL + SHIFT + 0 (restart) then CTRL + SHIFT + S (source the current script). On a Mac, replace CTRL with CMD for the same effect.",

Once you have a directory with a few scripts, data files, output files, and / or graphs, create a project to hold it all.\n\nGo to File &gt; New Project\nSelect the “Existing Directory” option\n\nIn the “Project Working Directory”, click “Browse” and find the directory with your scripts and data files.\n\nClick “Create Project”\n\nNow, any work you do in that project will be associated with your previous work. All your files stay nice and organized. You will use this project to store figures for your publications, as well as the scripts you used to create them. This means that the next time your pesky reviewer asks you to change a plot label, you don’t have to deal with editing the .JPG or .PDF file—you can simply re-run the code to build a new picture! Your data files, analysis scripts, output .csv’s, and publication graphics all stay together under the project banner.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNoteExercises\n\n\n\nExercises\n\nCreate a folder for your work in this class.\nCreate organized subfolders similar to what we discussed in class.

I recommend project based folders with use-type subfolders. For example, I have a directory called “Teaching”, with a subdirectory for this class. That subdirectory is organized by the type or use of the files: “admin” for attendance, syllabus, and course schedule, “lectures” for my class notes, etc.\nWrite an organization plan that you can stick with.\nOrganize all the files on your computer.
