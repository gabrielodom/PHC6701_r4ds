# Overview
In this lesson, we will cover the following:

1. Control Flow in R
2. Creating Functions
3. Best Practices
4. Function Scoping
5. Applying Functions to Vectors

## Preliminary Comments
Functions are what gives R its power and flexibility, but it is also what gives R its incredibly steep learning curve. All of the material in this lesson is considerably more challenging than what you've done in this class so far. However, if you can understand functions and how to apply them to the vectors you have already created, you can do almost anything you will ever need to do. This lesson is high-difficulty, high-reward.

## Expressions
All of these sections make use of *expressions*. An expression in R is a line of code or multiple lines of code that accomplish one or more tasks when executed. In this sense, we have been using expressions since day 1. For this lesson, when we say *expression*, think "some code that will do something without errors". Some expressions are simple, like `"Hello, world!"`, while others are far more complicated (like the chains of `dplyr` functions from last lesson).


</br>

*******************************************************************************
</br>

# Control Flow in R
In modern computer languages, we have access to primitive statements that "control" the "flow" of how we solve problems. They are the building blocks upon which the rest of the language is constructed. These building blocks themselves aren't always as easy to use or easy to understand, but they are worth a look.

## **IF** then **ELSE** then
The IF/ELSE router controls a set of expressions and evaluates them based on a **single logical condition** (that is, a logical atomic vector with length 1). We saw a variant of this when we used the `case_when()` function last lesson. Here is an example.
```{r}
# Draw a single random number from the normal distribution
xRand <- rnorm(1)

# If the value is negative, say so
if (xRand < 0) { "This value is negative." }
```

Let's unpack this example. The `if` function is a special function that does not use the normal `functionName(arg1 = val1)` syntax. The syntax is `if (CONDITION) {THEN DO}`. If the single atomic logical value in the parentheses is TRUE, then execute the expression in the curly braces. That is, if `xRand < 0` evaluates to `TRUE`, then print `"This value is negative."`

What about if the value is positive? We could add another `if () {}` control, or we could use the `else` function. Like the `if` function, it also has a special syntax that can only be used with an `if` function. That syntax is `if (CONDITION) {THEN DO} else {THEN DO}`. For example:
```{r}
xRand <- rnorm(1)

if (xRand < 0) { "This value is negative." } else { "You're a winner!" }
```

Because these expressions can often span multiple lines, we often write IF/ ELSE controls like this:
```{r}
xRand <- rnorm(1)

if (xRand < 0) {
  "This value is negative."
} else {
  "You're a winner!"
}
```

> Exercise: Use an IF/ELSE chain to replicate the functionality of the absolute value function (`abs()`).

## **FOR**
The FOR controller allows us to repeat a task for some pre-defined number of times. Unlike the IF/ELSE control, the FOR control only makes sense to use with vectors with length greater than 1. 
```{r}
for (j in 1:10) { print(j + 1) }
```

Let's unpack the FOR loop. The FOR loop has the following syntax: `for (INDEX in VECTOR) {DO f(INDEX)}`, where `f(INDEX)` is some expression or function using the value of the index (though in some FOR loops the value of the index isn't used at all).

Now, it is important to understand the following: **FOR loops are rarely useful in R, because R is a vectorised language**. We could have done the exact same computation much simpler if we make use of R's natural processing of vectors:
```{r}
(1:10) + 1
```

However, FOR loops in R are critical when we need to create a function who's values at one position depend on the values before it; these constraints occur when simulating or analysing observations over time, where the value of the vector at position `i` depends on the value at `i - 1`. As a more complicated example, we will create the Fibonacci Sequence:
```{r}
# Create empty vector of length 50
fiboRes_int <- rep(NA_integer_, 50)
# Initialize
fiboRes_int[1] <- 1L
fiboRes_int[2] <- 1L

for (i in 3:50) {
  fiboRes_int[i] <- fiboRes_int[i - 1] + fiboRes_int[i - 2]
}

fiboRes_int
```

The warning we see, and the missing values in the results vector, should serve as a warning that FOR loops are indeed powerful, but must be used with great care.

> Exercise: Remove the `print()` call within the expression for the first FOR loop. What happens? Can you infer anything special about what happens inside the `{` `}`?

## **WHILE**  and **BREAK**
The WHILE controller allows us to repeat a task for an undefined number of times. Unlike the FOR control, the WHILE control can continue to run indefinitely. **USE WITH EXTREME CAUTION.**

WHILE loops are the foundtional controller for most iterative mathematical algorithms. Because they can continue to compute indefinitely, they are also used to model scenarios where unknown or random forces act on objects. For example, pretend that we have a social game where an individual will continue to play until they reach a condition; e.g. speed dating, where a person (say "Todd, a software developer") will continue to move from table to table until they find "the one", upon which they exit the game.

Because WHILE loops can execute until the heat death of the universe, we recommend that you add a print statement that counts how many loops have been made. For example, let's find out how many dates Todd goes on during the speed dating event:
```{r}
# Initialize
hasDate <- 0
attempts <- 1

while (hasDate != 1) {
  
  # Make a condition that only happens with 2.5% chance
  hasDate <- rnorm(1) < -1.96
  attempts <- attempts + 1
  print(attempts)
  
}
```

Now, as I played this example on my computer, I had one time where the WHILE loop repeated 60 times before the success condition was reached. In these cases, it would be nice to have a stopping condition. In our example, we can assume that there are only 30 potential date candidates for Todd to meet at the event, so we *break* the loop if we reach 30 attempts. This "exit" strategy uses the BREAK controller:
```{r}
# Initialize
hasDate <- 0
attempts <- 1

while (hasDate != 1) {
  
  # Make a condition that only happens with 2.5% chance
  hasDate <- rnorm(1) < -1.96
  attempts <- attempts + 1
  
  if(attempts > 30L){
    
    print("No date found.")
    break
    
  }
  
  print(attempts)
  
}
```

> 2. Read the lessons under the "Decision and Loop" section of DataMentor's *R Programming* page: <https://www.datamentor.io/r-programming/#tutorial>

Did you notice that `if`, `else`, `for`, `while`, and `break` all changed colour when you typed them? That is R telling you that these objects---**remember that everything in R is an object**---are *reserved*. That means that we cannot assign values to them or use them for any reason other than their designed purpose.

</br>

*******************************************************************************
</br>

# Creating Functions
One of the other *reserved* objects in R is `function`. This is the reserved function object used to create all other non-reserved functions. Here is an example; we will create a function that says "hi" to us:
```{r}
greetMe <- function(){ "Hello, Dr. Gabriel!" }
```

This function is just like any other function you have used before. Call it by typing its name followed by `()`.
```{r}
greetMe()
```

## Function Arguments
Most functions we have used take in arguments; that is, they change their behaviour based on the values supplied to them. For example, we can create a function that finds the geometric mean of two numbers. In mathematics, this is
$$
f(x_1, x_2) := \sqrt{x_1 \cdot x_2},
$$
where the dot between the numbers is for multiplication. In code, this would be:
```{r}
geomMean <- function(a, b){ sqrt( a * b ) }
```

Once again, any time we create a function, we test it using values we know. For example, we know that the product of 5 and 20 is 100, and that the square root of 100 is 10. Thus, the geometric mean of 5 and 20 calculated by our function should be 10:
```{r}
geomMean(5, 20)
```

## Overview of Function Syntax
Just like the control flow functions, the `function` operator has very special syntax: `funName <- function(ARGUMENTS){ EXPRESSION USING ARGUMENTS }`. Moreover, because the expression inside the `{` `}` can be quite long and complex, the function returns whatever happens on the **last line**. Up to this point, both of our functions have only had one line, so that was the last line by default.

For example, we can write a version of the `abs()` function by nesting an an IF statement within a function. If we ever need to have our function stop execution and return a value early, we can use the **RETURN** controller:
```{r}
absoluteValue <- function(num){
  
  out <- num
  
  if(num < 0){
    return(-out)
  }
  
  out
  
}
```

When we test this function, we need to try it with both a positive and a negative number for `num`:
```{r}
absoluteValue(5)
absoluteValue(-5)
```



> Exercises:
> 
> 1. Create a function that finds out if Todd gets a date. The argument of the function is the number of pairs at the event. Replace the `30L` in the WHILE loop above with this argument.
2. Go back an read the section on functions in HOPR Chapter 1.

<!-- ```{r} -->
<!-- hasDate <- function(numPairs){ -->

<!--   hasDate <- 0 -->
<!--   attempts <- 1 -->

<!--   while (hasDate != 1) { -->

<!--     # Make a condition that only happens with 2.5% chance -->
<!--     hasDate <- rnorm(1) < -1.96 -->
<!--     attempts <- attempts + 1 -->

<!--     if(attempts > numPairs){ -->

<!--       return("No date found.") -->

<!--     } -->

<!--   } -->

<!--   paste("After", attempts, "tries, Todd found a date.") -->

<!-- } -->

<!-- # Test -->
<!-- hasDate(numPairs = 50) -->
<!-- ``` -->

# Function Best Practices
Because R is a functional language, the functions you write should be the most important pieces of your code. Functions in R, through their inherent vectorized efficiency, turn this
```
lsum <- 0
for (i in 1:length(x)) {
  lsum <- lsum + log(x[i])
}
```
into this
```
lsum <- sum(log(x))
```
(This and other mortal R sins are covered in [The R Inferno](http://www.burns-stat.com/documents/books/the-r-inferno/).) R is a *functional* programming language, so you must *learn to use functions* in your code. Furthermore, while this isn't required, you should probably think about collecting the functions you write into a package. Here are some guidelines on writing functions:

1. **Functions should do one major thing, only that thing, and that thing well.** A function that does a million things is easy to break and horribly difficult to test. Keep your functions simple, and you will not regret it.
2. **Major functions should be saved with their documentation in their own script files.**  Overall, this encourages your project code to be compartmentalized, organized, and well-documented. I *strongly* recommend you do not store all of your functions in one file. If you have a ton of functions to source all at once, create a package. Even if you never plan to release the code to anyone outside your group, *create a package anyway*.
3. **Utility functions can be collected into one file.** Because you probably do not need extensive documentation of utility functions, you can store all related utility functions together.

# Function Scoping
Recall the `absoluteValue()` function we wrote. Inside this function, we created an object called `out`. Is this object in your global environment?

While you have your guesses for where the `out` object went, let's create an `out` object in the global environment:
```{r}
out <- "This is a character string, and clearly not a number."
```

What happens to our `absoluteValue()` function now?
```{r}
absoluteValue(6)
```

> Exercise: Discuss the above questions.

We get the same behaviour we saw before. Why doesn't our function return this `out` object we created? 

## Environments
When we executed the function above, R created a brand new *environment* for the function to work in. Think back to our first lesson on vectors. We saw this image:

![](../figures/vectors_object_review.png)
An *environment* is a special type of object that makes it possible to create other objects. **Environments connect, or *bind*, object names to their values.** Technically speaking, the figure above is wrong, because it puts all objects inside an environment, when an environment itself is an object. Remember that **everything in R is an object**. However, this figure is a useful abstraction to help us understand the connections between functions and vectors.

On the second day of class, when we first used the assignment operator (`<-`), we used it to create an object named `x` that held the value `2`. However, we now understand that `x <- 2` **binds** the value `2` to the name `x` within our current *environment* (in our case, the Global Environment). Think about an environment like a sandbox that we can sit in to play with all of our objects.

## Function Environments and Scoping
When we called the function `absoluteValue(num = 5)`, R created a brand new environment with one object binding: the name `num` was bound to the object `5`. (This is the primary use of the `=` operator; it creates objects to be used within a function environment.) Note that we could not see this environment, but it was there. Our `absoluteValue()` function did its work, returned the absolute value of 5, and then R destroyed the environment it created. When we called the function a second time, R created a brand new environment that had *no memory that the first environment ever existed* and repeated the same process.

### Inspecting the Function Expression
Let's take a look at the arguments and expression of the function:
```
(num){
  
  out <- num
  
  if(num < 0){
    return(-out)
  }
  
  out
  
}
```

When we execute this function by running the code `absoluteValue(5)`, R first creates a brand-new, completely empty environment, and then performs the assignment `num = 5` in it. This action is also known as binding, so we could also say that *R binds 5 to the name "num" in the function environment*.

Then, R executes the code in our expression, line by line, until the last line. So,

1. R creates an object called `out` in this new environment and stores the number 5 in it. Then,
2. R checks to see if the original value of `num` is negative; if so,
     + R RETURNs the value of `out` multiplied by negative 1.
     + If this check was not `TRUE`, then R reaches the last line of the function. 
3. Finally, if R reaches the last line, it sees the expression `out`. If you type the name of an object in your "Console" and hit "Enter", R will print the contents of that object. Because the function has reached its last line, we don't need to explicitly type a RETURN control---it's called automatically. Thus, the last line of this expression is to print to the "Console" the contents of the object `out` contained in the function environment.

### Looking "Up"
When a function can't find an object you reference in one environment, it "looks up" to the "next" environment. This action of "looking up" through environments is called *scoping*. The "next" environment up from your current environment is called the *parent* environment.

Now, let's create a new function that RETURNs the object `out` without defining it in the function environment:
```{r}
badTestFun <- function(){
  out
}

badTestFun()
```

Now, let's try it on an object we know doesn't exist in any environment:
```{r, error=TRUE}
badTestFun2 <- function(){
  object_that_I_know_doesnt_exist_because_this_name_is_long_and_dumb
}

badTestFun2()
```


> Exercises:
>
> 1. Discuss what you think just happened. Why did `badTestFun()` return something while `badTestFun2()` triggered an error?
> 2. Execute the `search()` function. What do you think this function returns?

# Applying Functions to Vectors
Now that we understand functions, how they work, and the best practices for writing them, we can start *applying* our functions to our data. Recall that most objects in R are either functions or vectors. We saw that the FOR loop controller was capable of evaluating a function with each element of a vector (for instance, adding up all the values of a vector using a FOR loop). We also saw that, for most cases, R's vectorised nature makes using FOR loops unnecessary. 

For this section, we will need the `tidyverse` again:
```{r, message=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
```


## Example: The Convergence of the Sample Mean
During this, my 10th lesson in statistical computing, we will finally do a little bit of "traditional" statistics. Here is the general premise: the sample mean is an "unbiased" estimator. That is, if you take larger and larger samples from the population, the difference between the sample mean and the population mean goes to 0. To test this, we will first generate a medium-sized population from a random normal distribution (the `set.seed()` function allows me to generate the same random population each time, so that everyone can reproduce the output of my code):
```{r}
# for reproducibility:
set.seed(12345) # if you change this number, you will get a different sample

population <- rnorm(100)
```

What is the population mean ($\mu$)?
```{r}
mu <- mean(population)
mu
```

### List of Samples
Now, we want to take samples from the population, where each sample is bigger than the last. That is, we will start with a small batch of subjects (values from `population`), calculate the sample mean ($\bar{x}$), add a few more subjects, calculate the sample mean again, and repeat this until we reach the magical $n > 30$. Because each sample will be bigger than the last, we must use a *list*.
```{r}
samples_ls <- list(
  sample_0819 = population[1:5],
  sample_0826 = population[1:10],
  sample_0902 = population[1:15],
  sample_0909 = population[1:20],
  sample_0916 = population[1:25],
  sample_0923 = population[1:30]
)
```

### The FOR Loop
Now that we have our samples, we need to find the mean of each. Will simply taking the mean work?
```{r}
mean(samples_ls)
```

Unfortunately no. Based on what we learned previously about FOR loops, we can use one of those:
```{r}
# Initialize
nSamples <- length(samples_ls)
sampleMeans <- rep(NA_real_, nSamples)

# Loop
for (i in 1:nSamples) {
  sampleMeans[i] <- mean(samples_ls[[i]])
}
```

These are the mean values we calculated:
```{r}
sampleMeans
```


How far are these from the true population mean? We set this loop up to fill values into a numeric vector, so we can use R's vector power again:
```{r}
abs(mu - sampleMeans)
```

## Mapping a Defined Function to Values
This code was quite cumbersome. We had to measure how long the list was, create an empty atomic vector to hold our results, and then write the FOR loop to iterate over each position in the list of samples. On top of all of this, we've added this useless `i` object to the Global Environment, and the FOR loop lost the names of the samples! There is a better way: the `map()` function from the `purrr` package (included in the `tidyverse`, so remember to load that package):
```{r}
map(samples_ls, mean)
```

> Exercises:
> 
> 1. This function does return the values we want, but it does so as a list. We would like an atomic vector. Check the help files for this function to find out what to change.
> 2. While you are in the help file for `map()`, find out how to pass in a second argument to the `mean()` function. Set `na.rm = TRUE` and test it.

## `map()` Syntax
In order to use the `map()` function and its friends, follow the following syntax: `map(VECTOR, FUNCTION)`. That's it. For example, to find the summary of each column in the `mpg` data set, type:
```{r}
map(mpg, summary)
```

This example shows that the `summary()` function isn't very helpful for character information. We are immediately motivated us to ask, "Can I write my own function for `map()` to use?" The answer is YES!

### Sample Means with `map()`
Back to our first example, we still want to find out how close the sample mean gets to the population mean as we increase the sample size. For this, we write our own function to pass to `map()`. Recall the function constructor:
```{r}
# Create the function
absMean <- function(xBar_num, mu_num){
  abs(mean(xBar_num) - mu_num)
}

# Map it
# Recall that the help file says that additional arguments to the function
#   and their values are added after the function name.
map_dbl(sampleMeans, absMean, mu_num = mu)
```

For better or for worse, this matches the output of what we calculated using the FOR loop exactly.

### An Improved `summary()`
We saw that when we applied `summary()` to each column of a tibble, the character columns didn't give us much information. We can then write our own summary function that prints the most common unique values:
```{r}
mySummary <- function(x){
  
  if (is.character(x)){
    
    table(x) %>% 
      sort(decreasing = TRUE) %>%
      head()
    
  } else {
    summary(x)
  }
  
}
```

Now we can apply it to the `mpg` data set:
```{r}
map(mpg, mySummary)
```

It's not terribly pretty (I am *not* a fan of the `table()` function), but it gives us a reasonable idea of what is going on in these columns.


> Exercises:
> 
> 1. Create a sequence of sample sizes from 5 to 100 by 5. Save this vector of sample sizes. *Hint: look up the help files for `sequence()`. You will find the function you need mentioned therein.*
> 2. Use the `map()` function combined with the sequence you just created to make a list of samples with increasing sizes from the `population` vector. Store it as another list of samples. This should make typing that list by hand obsolete.
> 3. Use the `map_dbl()` function combined with the `absMean()` function we created to calculate the atomic vector of absolute differences from the sample mean. At what sample size does the estimate get better? Should we always use the $n > 30$ rule for the sample mean?
> 4. Repeat the above process with the following modification: chain these operations together with pipes (`%>%`).

<!-- You can also chain everything together, and then pass it it `ggplot`: -->
<!-- ```{r} -->
<!-- # Create a sequence of sample sizes -->
<!-- seq(5, 100, by = 5) %>%  -->
<!--   # Create a list of larger and larger samples from the population -->
<!--   map(function(i) {population[1:i]}) %>% -->
<!--   # Take the absolute deviation from the population mean -->
<!--   map_dbl(absMean, mu_num = mu) %>% -->
<!--   # Make it a tibble (required for ggplot) -->
<!--   # The "." means "put the input from the pipe here" -->
<!--   tibble(means = .) %>% -->
<!--   # Add on a column for the index of the samples -->
<!--   mutate(index = 1:nrow(.)) %>% -->
<!--   # pass this new tibble with two columns to ggplot() -->
<!--   ggplot() + -->
<!--     aes(x = index, y = means) + -->
<!--     geom_path() -->
<!-- ``` -->
