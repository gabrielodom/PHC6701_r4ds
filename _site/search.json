For this part of data science, traditional statistics departments discuss only exploratory data analysis.\n\nExamples: designing the questions on a patient survey, creating a database to hold clinical trials data, finding the most common answers to a question, finding the largest or smallest values of a measurement, reporting the proportion of missing answers to a battery of questions between three cohorts."

For this portion of data science, traditional statistics departments only discuss mathematical transformations and their validity.\n\nExamples: extracting subject data from RedCap, building EMR reports, organizing hundreds or thousands of case report forms into a few data files, transforming age in months or weeks to age in years, grouping free-form text (“florida”, “Florida”, “fl”, and “FL” together)."

    "section": "Computing with Data",
    "text": "Computing with Data\nThis part of data science concerns creating new programming languages, developing algorithms, using programming languages to automate data preparation, representation, and exploration, and packaging code for easier use. Of these, traditional statistics departments have only cared about algorithms (and sometimes not even that). However, many statisticians are starting to change their focus where this area is concerned. In this class you will learn parts of a few different computing and reporting languages, such as R, SAS, SQL, markdown and LaTeX.\n\nExamples: the R language was created to give statisticians and data scientists more control over their research, algorithms to fit statistical and mathematical models are created all the time, and we can create “packages” of computer code to repeat the same types of analyses on new data sets."

    "section": "Data Modeling",
    "text": "Data Modeling\nThis part of data science is the most well-known portion. It is what most lay-people consider “data science”: statistical modelling and machine learning. This is where simple techniques like t-tests, linear regression, or ANOVA come in, but it also includes highly complex models and routines such as deep neural networks, random coefficient mixed models, support vector machines, or discriminant analysis. Traditional statistics departments have historically taught or developed most of these techniques, although some interesting modern research has come from computer science and econometrics."

    "section": "Data Visualization and Presentation",
    "text": "Data Visualization and Presentation\nThis portion of data science includes all sorts of visualizations, from plots to interactive websites and applets. Data visualisation itself is nice, but using computer code to generate these visualizations is of paramount importance. Without the data and code to create the visualization, it can not be reproducible. Furthermore, the presentation of data in order to further an argument or claim is part of visual rhetoric, and is subject to questions of ethics. In traditional statistics departments, some of these tools are used, but rarely taught.\n\nExamples: making a scatterplot comparing SAT scores at different levels of household income, making a map shading counties in Florida by their ovarian cancer rates, designing a website to plot demographic information based on user selections.\n\n“A picture is worth a thousand words. Make sure your picture says the right thousand words.”"

    "section": "Science about Data Science",
    "text": "Science about Data Science\nThis portion of data science involves research meta-analysis about the utility of statistical and computational tools across entire disciplines, including applying data science concepts in disciplines untouched by data science. Currently, this is an area of active research in data science itself. This portion of the discipline identifies the boundaries of the discipline itself, the proper and ethical uses for data science, and experiments with the best ways to teach data science concepts. As this section of data science deals with philosophy and ethics, it has hardly anything to do with academic statistics.\n\nExamples: apply machine learning to analyze the provenance of art owned by Jews that had been seized by the Nazis or property owned by political dissenters seized by the Soviets, creating online courses to teach the basics of data science and reproducible research to non-scientists, writing commentary on the ethics of misleading graphs and figures in political campaigns."

    "text": "Use Code!\nIf you want your analyses and figures to be reproducible, then you must use computer code to do this. Point-and-click software does not (usually) give you a record of your steps or allow you to repeat them. Building your data management, data modelling, and visualizations steps in a programming language means that you always have the tools necessary to repeat your work. In this class, you will learn how to write computer code to clean and transform your data, perform your analyses, and build the figures and tables for your papers. If you do this properly, this will ensure that anyone can recreate your analysis results, figures, and tables relatively quickly and painlessly."
