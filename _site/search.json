In this class you will learn parts of a few different computing and reporting languages, such as R, SAS, SQL, markdown and LaTeX.\n\nExamples: the R language was created to give statisticians and data scientists more control over their research, algorithms to fit statistical and mathematical models are created all the time, and we can create “packages” of computer code to repeat the same types of analyses on new data sets."

Data visualisation itself is nice, but using computer code to generate these visualizations is of paramount importance. Without the data and code to create the visualization, it can not be reproducible. Furthermore, the presentation of data in order to further an argument or claim is part of visual rhetoric, and is subject to questions of ethics. In traditional statistics departments, some of these tools are used, but rarely taught.\n\nExamples: making a scatterplot comparing SAT scores at different levels of household income, making a map shading counties in Florida by their ovarian cancer rates, designing a website to plot demographic information based on user selections.\n\n“A picture is worth a thousand words. Make sure your picture says the right thousand words.”"

This portion of the discipline identifies the boundaries of the discipline itself, the proper and ethical uses for data science, and experiments with the best ways to teach data science concepts. As this section of data science deals with philosophy and ethics, it has hardly anything to do with academic statistics.\n\nExamples: apply machine learning to analyze the provenance of art owned by Jews that had been seized by the Nazis or property owned by political dissenters seized by the Soviets, creating online courses to teach the basics of data science and reproducible research to non-scientists, writing commentary on the ethics of misleading graphs and figures in political campaigns."

This is not actually required but may be helpful.\nNotice the location of the line and star. I had to adjust their horizontal locations because factors in R do unexpected things: ggplot now places the bars at x = 1 and 2 instead of 0 and 1 because R is interpreting these factors as the numbers 1 and 2. We will discuss this more when we talk about atomic type coercion later this semester."

    "text": "Unpacking the Title\nWe will start with “graphics”, because most people are most familar with graphs. Then we will work backwards.\n\nGraphics\nIn computational parlance, a graphic is a visual representation of organized information, displayed to the screen or stored in a file. Consider this picture:\n\nThis is a visual representation of information, but it isn’t useful. It isn’t organized, and we cannot draw any meaning from it. The most basic graphic of our data is a screenshot of it, but that usually doesn’t help anyone!\n\n\nGrammar of Graphics\nAs we see in the figure above, we need our graphics to follow a set of rules. A grammar is a set of the fundamental principles and rules of a discipline, so the grammar of graphics is the set of fundamental rules for displaying organised information (Wickham, 2010).\n\nA grammar provides a strong foundation for understanding a diverse range of graphics. A grammar may also help guide us on what a well-formed or correct graphic looks like, but there will still be many grammatically correct but nonsensical graphics. This is easy to see by analogy to the English language: good grammar is just the first step in creating a good sentence. - Hadley Wickham\n\n\n\nLayering\nIf grammar helps us construct a sentence in the proper way, layering helps us combine multiple sentences into a paragraph. We use layers to “stack” different levels of results and statistics. Let’s walk through Wickham’s original example (ibid., p. 4).\n\nExample Data\nConsider the following toy data:\n\n\n\nA\nB\nC\nD\n\n\n\n\n2\n3\n4\na\n\n\n1\n2\n1\na\n\n\n4\n5\n15\nb\n\n\n9\n9\n80\nb\n\n\n\nA simple research question we may have is, does changing C affect A, and is this effect mitigated by D? To answer this, we would probably build a scatterplot of C and A, with point size, shape, or colour set by D. That is, we assign C to take values on the horizontal axis, A to take values on the vertical axis, and D to take values on some other axis (shape, for instance). The resulting data set looks like this:\n\n\n\nx\ny\nShape\n\n\n\n\n2\n4\na\n\n\n1\n1\na\n\n\n4\n15\nb\n\n\n9\n80\nb\n\n\n\nNow, we are making some progress, but we still haven’t told the computer what to do with this information. Recall that one of the major goals of this class is to help you tell the computer what you want. Your computer needs to translate these points and shape labels into actual pixels on the screen.\n\n\nExample Data Mapped\nLet’s pretend that we give a 200 x 300 window to R to plot these points. The resulting pixel locations and shapes will look like this:\n\n\n\nx\ny\nShape\n\n\n\n\n25\n11\ncircle\n\n\n0\n0\ncircle\n\n\n75\n53\nsquare\n\n\n200\n300\nsquare\n\n\n\nThis yields one layer with the overall shape and behaviour of the data:\n\nNotice however, that we don’t have any scales for these values. The values R supplied to the computer are in shapes and pixel locations, but we humans can’t interpret what this means. We need another layer for the axes.\n\nFinally, we need a layer for the labels. When we stack these layers (axes, labels, then data), we see the following composed graph:\n\nWhen we construct figures, we often take for granted the complexity inherent in the task. For our work, we will be constructing figures layer by layer, so it is important to understand these mechanics."

I will give you the code and the figure, then we will deconstruct it.\n\nggplot(data = mpg) +\n  aes(x = displ, y = hwy) +\n  geom_point()\n\n\n\n\nWell, at first glance, it certainly seems that larger engines are less fuel efficient.\nWithin the code itself, the components in this code are organized in a logical manner and with a corresponding set of rules—that is, a grammar. That’s what the gg part stands for—the grammar of graphics.\n\n+: The Layer Glue\nNotice that each of the lines above are connected by the plus sign, “+”. In this context, the + symbol operates to “add” layers together, but you can still use it to add numbers too. If you are more familiar with R, but not familiar with the tidyverse, then the idea of “adding” one function to another seems absurd. However, as you’ll see soon, we can “add” more and more layers to a single graph with this + operator.\n\n\nThe data Layer\nThe first line in the code, ggplot(data = mpg), provides the base layer of the graphic. Recall the function syntax we have learned previously:\n\nThe function is named ggplot\nThe first argument of the function is called data\nWe supply the data set mpg as the value to this data argument\n\nThink of this as a blank canvas that you will paint on. In this case, the data set mpg provides the material from which to create the canvas.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExercise\n\n\n\nRun ggplot(data = mpg). What does this look like?\n\n\nThe ggplot() function takes data tables only in a certain form. Recall the exercise from Lesson 1 on finding help? We first read about the str function then.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExercise\n\n\n\nUse the str() function to confirm that the mpg object has data.frame as one of its classes.\n\n\nIf you ever have trouble with ggplot(), make sure your data frame is tidy! Later this semester, we will discuss some things to do if your data table is not tidy (using the tidyr, tibble, and readr packages in the tidyverse).\n\n\nThe Aesthetic Mapping Layer\nNow that we have created a canvas to paint on, we need to choose our proverbial “colour palette” and plan where our “paintbrush” will go. That is, we need to specify which measurements contained in the mpg data set we are going to use, and how they will influence the blank canvas. Now, consider the second line of code: aes(x = displ, y = hwy). Following what we know about function syntax, we can deconstruct this line as follows:\n\nThe function is named aes\nThe first argument of the function is named x\nWe supply the value of the object displ as to the argument x\nThe second argument of the function is named y\nWe supply the value of the object hwy as to the argument y\n\nNow, if you have been paying attention, you’ll notice that we don’t have any objects named displ or hwy in the “Environment” pane.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExercises\n\n\n\n\nRun displ and hwy in the “Console”. What happens?\nRun\n\n\nggplot(data = mpg) +\n  aes(x = displ, y = hwy)\n\n\nHow is this different from the first layer alone? Remember to use the “+” symbol to add one layer to another.\n\nWhere did R find the values for displ and hwy? What would you do if you needed to add different values to the aesthetic layer?\nAdd 3 and 5 together. Is there anything else different with the + function?\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Geometric Object Layer\nWe now have a canvas to plot our points, and a system of axes to know where the points belong. Now we need to tell ggplot() how to plot x and y. This is where the the geom_*() functions come into play: we wanted a scatterplot, so we picked geom_point(). This is simply a call to the function geom_point with no arguments. “Geom” is short for “geometric object”, and there are quite a few geometric shapes we can bend our data into (more on this later).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExercises\n\n\n\n\nRun the original code (copied below) and compare it to the previous figure. What did the geometric layer add to the plot?\n\n\nggplot(data = mpg) +\n  aes(x = displ, y = hwy) +\n  geom_point()\n\n\nLook up the help manual for the geom_point function. Recall our conversation on functions in Lesson 1. What are some of the arguments for the geom_point function? Where do you think the values of the arguments for this function came from?"

Good for continuous and discrete features.\nsize: How big should the points be? Better for continuous features.\nalpha: How opaque / transparent should the points be? Values range from \\([0,1]\\), with \\(1\\) being completely opaque. Better for continuous features.\nshape: What shape should the points have? Better for discrete features. Options are shown below \nfill: For the shapes filled with red, what color should you put instead? Better for discrete features, but is limited when plotting points. The fill aesthetic truly shines with geoms other than point, but more on that later.\n\nFor most of these aesthetics, the behavior of the graph will change depending on if you map a discrete or continuous feature to it. For example, if you map a continuous feature to the colour aesthetic, the points will be given a continuous color gradient (by default, from dark blue to light blue). However, if you map character information to the colour aesthetic, the points will be distinctly different (discrete) in color."

    "text": "Examples\n\n\n\n\n\nLook back to the figure. You might notice that there is a group of five points on the top right that stick out: these cars have large engines but higher MPG than other vehicles with large engines. We could ask a few questions to try to explain this disparity:\n\nAre these vehicles hybrids?\nDo these vehicles use diesel?\nAre these vehicles newer?\n\nEach question is a hypothesis, and we will attempt to “test” these hypotheses visually.\n\nHypothesis 1: Outlier Cars are Hybrids\nCheck the help documentation for the mpg data set to find out which column measures the type of the car. We probably won’t see “hybrid”” in this list, because we know that very few hybrid cars were in production in both 1998 and 2008. These cars would have all been classified as “compact” or “sub-compact”. Note: this is where “domain knowledge” is critical for proper data science.\nNow what type of feature is class? The column header of the mpg data table informs us that this feature is a character feature (chr), and therefore discrete. Therefore, we can add it to the graph with the colour or shape aesthetics.\n\n\n\n\n\nIt appears that our hypothesis was incorrect. These vehicles are not small, hybrid cars at all, but sports cars or midsize cars.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExercise\n\n\n\nWrite the code necessary to create the above graph.\n\n\n\n\nHypothesis 2: Outlier Cars take Diesel\n\n\n\n\n\nOur hypothesis is incorrect. It appears that all five of our outlier vehicles take premium fuel (“p”), not diesel (“d”). This graph, when paired with the previous graph on car class, gives us a better understanding of factors that could influence the relationship between engine size and fuel economy.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExercises\n\n\n\n\nUsing the help manual for the mpg data set, find which feature of the data measures fuel type.\nWrite the code necessary to create the above graph. Hint: the shape of the points is controlled by the shape argument to the aes() function.\n\n\n\n\n\nHypothesis 3: Outlier Cars are Newer\nWe know that vehicle year can be either 1998 or 2008. Because the manufacture year is a time, we should add it to the graph with the colour, size, fill, or alpha aesthetics.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe manufacture year doesn’t help explain the five outlier points very well. They are rather evenly split between 2000 and 2008.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExercise\n\n\n\nWrite the code necessary to create the above graph. Hint: the shape is not dependent on the data, so it is not an aesthetic. Think about where you should put the shape argument if you can’t put it in the aes() function.\n\n\n\n\nUpdated Hypothesis: Outlier Cars are Sportscars\nWe can add more than 3 features to a plot. Let’s create an engine size by MPG plot with fuel type and car class added.\n\n\n\n\n\nThis looks promising: it appears that all five outliers take premium fuel, and four of the five outliers are 2-seater coupes. This means that our outliers are probably sports / performance cars: larger engines but lighter bodies.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExercise\n\n\n\nWrite the code necessary to create the above graph.\n\n\nIf you’re thinking to yourself, “I wish there was a way to clean this graph up, to only show the premium fuel and two-seater cars”, then you are thinking what I’m thinking. However, we need some functions from the dplyr package first, which we will cover in a few weeks. The ggplot package also gives us a way to break graphs into mutually-exclusive pieces, called facets, which we will discuss shortly."

There are a few conventions for naming things:\n\nsnake_case\ncamelCase\nperiod.case\naBsoLUTE.andCOMPLETE_utternonsense\n\nNotice another thing about my object names: they all end with a brief tag explaining what type of object they are (we will cover object classes in more detail next lesson). myMessage_char is a character string, while myAge_num is a number (numeric, technically). I recommend using camelCase followed by an abbreviation for the type of the object, but you can pick whatever convention you like (but please be consistent).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExercises\n\n\n\n\nYou have imported a spreadsheet of phenotype data for subjects with colorectal adenocarcinoma.

    "text": "Basic Function Syntax\nMost R functions look like this: functionName(argument1 = value1, argument2 = value2, ...). This function is an object called functionName. We don’t know what it does, because the operations of the function are stored within the object functionName. We do know that it takes in two arguments with two values, and does something to them. Let’s use a function to create our first matrix (I’ve annotated the code to show its similarities with an English sentence):\n\n# object      verb   subject1  adverb1   adverb2\nmyData_mat <- matrix(data = 0, nrow = 5, ncol = 2)\nmyData_mat\n\n     [,1] [,2]\n[1,]    0    0\n[2,]    0    0\n[3,]    0    0\n[4,]    0    0\n[5,]    0    0\n\n\nNotice a few things. We used a function called matrix (a verb) with three arguments (data, nrow, and ncol). This function did some things behind the scenes (as defined in the object matrix), and returned an output. This output is a matrix of zeroes (the “noun”) with two columns and five rows (adverbs controlling how the verb should work; not all functions use additional arguments to change their behaviour, but most do). The data input was recycled to fill the entire matrix.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExercise\n\n\n\nLabel the “subjects”, “verbs”, “adverbs”, and “objects” in the following code:\n\nggplot(data = mpg) +\n  aes(x = displ, y = hwy) +\n  geom_point()"

    "text": "Our First Function\nSo far, we have only used functions that R provided for us or functions out of supplemental R packages. However, there are many instances where we need to create our own functions. Because we know that functions are also objects, we can create them just like anything else: with a creation function. Function creation has the following syntax:\n\nmyFun_fun <- function(argument1){\n  \n  body\n  \n}\n\nWe can use this syntax to create a function to add two numbers (obviously this function already exists, but bear with me).\n\nmySum_fun <- function(x, y){ x + y }\nmySum_fun(2, 3)\n\n[1] 5\n\n\nWe can create many of our own functions, and use these functions to accomplish very difficult tasks. This flexibility to create any function we can think of is one of R’s greatest strengths, but also part of what gives R its distinct learning curve.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExercises\n\n\n\n\nCreate a new function to greet someone good morning. The argument of your function should be who, and it’s value should be a character.

    "section": "Function Best Practices",
    "text": "Function Best Practices\nBecause R is a functional language, the functions you write should be the most important pieces of your code. Functions in R, through their inherent vectorized efficiency, turn this\nlsum <- 0\nfor (i in 1:length(x)) {\n  lsum <- lsum + log(x[i])\n}\ninto this\nlsum <- sum(log(x))\n(This and other mortal R sins are covered in The R Inferno.) R is a functional programming language, so you must learn to use functions in your code. Furthermore, while this isn’t required, you should probably think about collecting the functions you write into a package. Here are some guidelines on writing functions:\n\nFunctions should do one major thing, only that thing, and that thing well. A function that does a million things is easy to break and horribly difficult to check. Keep your functions simple, and you will not regret it.\nMajor functions should be saved in their own script files. This encourages your project code to be compartmentalized and organized. For projects, this is very important for testing and organization. Overall, I strongly recommend you do not store all of your functions in one file. If you have a ton of functions to source all at once, create a package. Even if you never plan to release the code to anyone outside your group, create a package anyway.\nUtility functions can be collected into one file. Because you probably do not need extensive documentation or checking of utility functions, you can store all related utility functions together."

    "text": "Documenting your Functions\nCode comments are the glue that hold a collaboration team together across time and space. You write comments to three people: yourself today, yourself in six months, and people who have never seen your code. These comments will include:\n\nthe function name and description,\nnames and descriptions for each argument to the function,\na description of what the function returns,\na thorough commentary on how the function works,\nat least one working example, and\ncitation, external links, internal links, etc. all as appropriate.\n\nComments always have a single space between the comment character (#) and the start of the comment. If your functions are not saved within a package, add these same comments as the first lines within your function. This ensures that the comments about the function always travel with the function.\nExample:\nCalculateSampleCovariance <- function(x, y, verbose = TRUE) {\n  # Computes the sample covariance between two vectors.\n  #\n  # Args:\n  #   x: One of two vectors whose sample covariance is to be calculated.\n  #   y: The other vector. x and y must have the same length, greater than one,\n  #      with no missing values.\n  #   verbose: If TRUE, prints sample covariance as a sentence; if not, not. \n  #      Default is TRUE.\n  #\n  # Returns:\n  #   The sample covariance between x and y.\n  # \n  # Example:\n  # CalculateSampleCovariance(x = rnorm(10), y = rnorm(10))\n  \n  \n  n <- length(x)\n  # Error handling\n  if (n <= 1 || n != length(y)) {\n    stop(\"Arguments x and y have different lengths: \",\n         length(x), \" and \", length(y), \".\")\n  }\n  if (TRUE %in% is.na(x) || TRUE %in% is.na(y)) {\n    stop(\" Arguments x and y must not have missing values.\")\n  }\n  covariance <- var(x, y)\n  if (verbose)\n    cat(\"The covariance is \", round(covariance, 4), \".\\n\", sep = \"\")\n  return(covariance)\n}"

    "section": "Code “Paragraph” Rules",
    "text": "Code “Paragraph” Rules\nJust like written paragraphs in English have certain rules, code scripts also have rules and best practices to help keep your work organized. Let’s consider an example data analysis for argument’s sake. We need to import the data, clean it, wrangle it (more on this next class), analyze it, and graph the results.\nThese rules are loosely ordered by importance:\n\nAll the code in one script should be related to one subtopic of your analysis. For instance, in the data analysis example above, we would create a seperate script for data import and cleaning, a script for wrangling and transformation, an analysis script, and a graphics script.\nScripts should be named (and often dated) based on what part of the workflow they handle. For example, the analysis script may be called breast_cancer_data_analysis_201906.R. Ordered files in a project pipeline should have leading numbers (00_clean_raw_data.R, 01_explore_clean_data.R, …) to keep presentation orderly.\nPartition chunks, or blocks, of code into sections with six pound signs on either side of a block title. This helps to keep your thoughts organized. Many times I will see that a code block has become very large, which prompts me that it should be it’s own script. In the RStudio IDE, when you name a code block, the name of that block will appear in the bottom left of the Editor pane, right next to the code GPS. If you haven’t organized your script into chunks yet, you should see (Top Level) or Untitled in this space. Here’s an example:\n\n######  New Code Section  #####################################################\n# A new code section in an R script is created with six pound signs (#), two\n#   spaces, the section description, two more spaces, and pound signs until the\n#   80th character slot is reached.\n\nNon-trivial code should be annotated with helpful or clarifying comments. Use the # (pound sign, or hashtag, depending on your age) to comment a single line of code in R. When you add comments to your code, try as much as possible to answer why you wrote the code that you did and the way you did, rather than simply parroting what your line of code does. Remember, comments should never simply “parrot” the code.\nLines in your script should be at or fewer than 80 characters wide whenever possible. You can use the “Code GPS” on the bottom left of the Editor pane to tell you where in the script you are. Why 80 characters per line? Because we are slaves to tradition. Different people have different size computer monitors, and lines that are 80 characters wide can easily be displayed on all sorts of screens. Also, 80-character lines fit on a printed page or in vignette PDFs very well. This rule serves another purpose: if your lines are consistently over 80 characters, this is a signal to you that you need to make your code simpler. If this is not possible, then think of this as an opportunity to write a function to make your code cleaner.\nUse two spaces (no tabs) for indentation. If you ever decide to release a package, then spacing becomes important for R documentation and meta-data files. It’s good to get into the habit of using the “two-space” indentation rule in any case; also, the RStudio IDE does this for you automatically most of the time.\nPad all operator calls with single spaces. Similar to the “80 characters wide” rule, this rule has no bearing on how the code executes, but makes a world of difference to human readability. An exception is commas: commas have one space after but no space before. Overall, don’tmakecodehardertoreadthanithastobe, and GIVE YOUR CODE SOME SPACE. Examples:\n\nrandErr_num <- rnorm(25, sd = 0.1) instead of randErr_num<-rnorm(25,sd=0.1).\nloss <- 3 or loss < -3 instead of loss<-3.\nif (check) { instead of if(check){\n\nMinutiae: Use <- for assignment, not =. Do not end lines with ;. Use double quotes instead of single quotes."

    "text": "Project Directory\nInstead, organize your files by project. These directory names and contents are quite flexible. However, you should pick a directory design and be consistent with it. Here’s an example directory:\n\nThe project directory is for my lectures in the Quantitative Science Clinics for the Sylvester Comprehensive Cancer Center at the University of Miami. Within this directory, I have the following folders:\n\nCode (miscellaneous) or scripts. These are the code scripts to import and clean the data, perform the analysis, tidy the output, create figures and tables, and save the results. Remember, all of these scripts should be related to the current project!\nPackage directory for the project (optional). If you created a package (pipeline) to analyze any data of a certain type, the package should be in the directory you use it (unless it’s a pipeline you use for many different projects, then it should probably be hosted on GitHub).\nRaw and clean data. Any input files go in this folder (even if you pre-process them). Unless the point of your project is to simply clean data, then cleaned data is not an output!\nArticles, user guides, or manuals (often for the literature review of the manuscript or report that you will write to accompany the project). These are the papers, books, articles, etc. you had to read to understand the project. This directory should also include setup documentation from your PI and any data dictionaries. Any written documentation that helped you set up your work or understand your team’s work goes here. Also, this is where you save the bibliography files.\nWritten summaries and manuscript files (drafts, LaTeX logs, etc.). When writing a LaTeX manuscript or an .html report, I usually put each draft in its own subfolder. Also, when you write papers, make sure to mark the draft number as the first two characters of the file name; e.g. 01-draft_modifiedPCA.docx, 02-draft_modifiedPCA.docx. I’ve often seen that one number isn’t enough (only 9 potential drafts). This keeps you from wasting time looking for the latest version.\nProject README. This should be a simple text (.txt) or markdown (.md) file that explains what the point of the project is, and where to find all of the important files. Also, this document should have the start date of the project, the date of the most recent major revision, and the names and emails of your main collaborators. This way, if you reference a “Mandy” somewhere in your notes or file names, everyone know you’re talking about “Amanda from the statistics department”.\nFigures and tables (output files). If your paper has a results section, all that information goes here. Everything that is an “end” of an analysis goes here.\nRStudio Project File. If I were to double-click on this file, RStudio would open with all of my files that I was working in when I last saved that project. When you use RStudio projects, you don’t have to remember all the files you had in use and manually re-open them. I recommend that as soon as you have more that one script (or a single long script that you really should have broken into a few different scripts already—jeez), you create an RStudio project to organize your files."

Consider this analogy: you have a meal container, you put the number 2 in it, and you label the container as x.\n\nSo far, you have used “containers” without labelling them. When you executed 24 * 7, R created a container and put the number 168 in it. However, R is like a vigilant office administrator: anything unlabelled in the refrigerator will be tossed out! Thus, if you wanted access to this number again, you must calculate 24 * 7 from scratch.\nWe can perform calculations with objects just like we could with anything contained in that object. For instance, if you wanted 10 to the power of 2, we see that the following are equivalent:\n\n10 ^ 2\n\n[1] 100\n\n10 ^ x\n\n[1] 100\n\n\nJust like any real lunch container, we can always empty out old food and put new food in it.

Recall that to use a keyboard shortcut, the “+” symbol means “press these keys at the same time”.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExercises\n\n\n\n\nCreate an object named myState that holds your current state of residence (e.g., “Florida”). Use the logical check for equality to show that the myState object and the object “florida” are not equal.\nCreate a new object y which is x + 3. Examine y. Now assign x to be “FL”. What happens to y? Why? What does this tell you about x?"

    "text": "Vectors\nRecall that our examples had scalar values? R, however, is designed to work with ordered sets of values, known as a vector. There are a few simple ways to make vectors in R, depending on what you want these vectors to contain. Let’s first make a vector of the digits on a keypad.\n\nkeypad <- 0:9\n\nWe see that the syntax a:b creates a sequence of integers from a to b. We can do everything with a vector of numbers that we could do with a scalar value:\n\nkeypad + 3\n\n [1]  3  4  5  6  7  8  9 10 11 12\n\nkeypad * 2\n\n [1]  0  2  4  6  8 10 12 14 16 18\n\n10 - keypad\n\n [1] 10  9  8  7  6  5  4  3  2  1\n\n2 ^ keypad\n\n [1]   1   2   4   8  16  32  64 128 256 512\n\nkeypad < 5\n\n [1]  TRUE  TRUE  TRUE  TRUE  TRUE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExercises\n\n\n\n\nCreate a sequence from 70 to 100. How does the display of this vector differ from the display of the object keypad?\nCreate a vector called revKeypad with the integers from 9 to 0.\nAll of the values we combined with the keypad vector were scalars. Multiply two vectors together: revKeypad * keypad. What happened? Is this what you expected?\nCreate a new vector of integers from -1 to 1. Multiply this new vector by keypad. What happened? Is this what you expected?"

For instance, the function to take an arithmetic mean in R is mean(). When you type mean in the Console pane, RStudio displays a hint on how to use the function. Let’s use this hint to find the expected roll on a six-sided die:\n\nmean(x = 1:6)\n\n[1] 3.5\n\n\nWe unpack this as follows:\n\nThe function is named “mean”.\nThe mean function has an argument named “x”.\nWe supply the vector of integers from 1 to 6 as the value to the argument “x”.\n\nWe can even put functions inside of other functions:\n\nlog(c(10, 100, 1000))\n\n[1] 2.302585 4.605170 6.907755\n\n\nNotice that the name of the argument to the mean() function is “x”. Most functions have named arguments, but the c() function does not. It allows you to choose your own names.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExercises\n\n\n\n\nCreate a vector of your first name, last name, and your degrees with the c() function.\nCreate the same vector as above, but name each of the components as you create the vector. Hint: think back to how we referenced the name of the argument for the mean() function."

    "text": "Inspecting your Quarto File\nWe should all see this basic Quarto template:\n\nLet’s dive in to the structure and syntax of this document.\n\nThe Meta-Data Header\nThe first few lines of the document are the document header. These lines tell R crucial information about how to build your report. The entire header, and all of the document options in it, are bounded by the three horizontal dashes (---) above and below.\nCurrently our header is quite basic. It includes:\n\nThe title of the document; title: \"My First Quarto\"\nWho wrote it: author: \"Gabriel Odom\"\nToday’s date: date: \"format(Sys.time(), '%b %d, %Y')\" (this looks crazy, but don’t worry about it now; we will learn what this means later if we need to)\nThe output type: format: html\n\nNotice that each one of these options (other than the date) are directly filled by your choices in the previous window.\n\n\nCode Chunks\nThe next thing we see is a code chunk. Code chunks look like this:\n\nThe components are:\n\nComputing language: Quarto documents can compile more than just R code, but we specify the language R here (with r).\nChunk name: this part is not required, but it can be helpful if you have errors in your code to know where they come from.\nChunk options: there are a few common options, which we will discuss later. This echo=false option means that this code chunk will not be included in the report output.\nChunk delimiters: all code chunks start and end with three backticks (```). If you want code that will run in a certain language (which most of the time, we do), add {} after the opening set of backtick delimiters, and put the language in first. For example, a basic code chunk could look like\n\n\n\nChunk body: this is where you put the actual R code that you want to compute.\n\nNotice two more things: 1) code chunks are on a grey background so they are easier to spot in the document, and 2) you can test the code in the chunk by clicking the green “Run Current Chunk” button on the top right.\n\n\nMarkup Text\nNow that you have a report with a header and some code, you need to explain what your code is doing and why. This is where the plain text comes in. Outside of a code chunk, type anything you want. You can even include pictures and tables. We will discuss these options, and the text formatting options, later.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExercise\n\n\n\nSave the report. Mac Users: make sure you add .qmd to the end of the file name."
